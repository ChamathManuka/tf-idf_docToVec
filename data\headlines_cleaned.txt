un high commissioner for human rights zeid raad al hussein concluding his four day visit to sri lanka said the prime ministers recent statements that nearly all the disappeared persons are dead has created great distress among their families he urged the government to quickly find a formula to charge or release the remaining securityrelated detaineesfurther the un rights chief said the countrys justice system has become highly politicised unbalanced unreliable the countrys history over the past few decades is littered with judicial failures virtually all sri lankans recognise this and the prime minister commented on it at great length and with admirable candour during a january debate in parliamentfurther hussein said it is for these reasons that the report and the human rights council resolution suggest international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations committed by individuals on both sides this is a practical proposal to solve the very real and practical problems i mentioned earlier but it is only one aspect albeit a very important one of the broad range of measures outlined in the un report and resolution and the extent to which it has been allowed to dominate the debate in sri lanka in recent days is unfortunate extreme nationalistic tendencies lay at the heart of sri lankas conflict and they should not be allowed to undermine the countrys long term chances of recovery once again the full statement is as follows i come to you shortly after wrapping up my visit here with meetings with president maithripala sirisena and prime minister ranil wickremesinghe and the leader of the opposition in which we discussed a wide range of issues that will have an important bearing on the future of sri lanka since arriving here on saturday i have also met the ministers of foreign affairs justice national dialogue and prison reforms rehabilitation and resettlement as well as the defence secretary chief of defence staff army and air force commanders and the chief of staff of the navyin addition here in colombo i visited the human rights commission of sri lanka and the task force that will lead the forthcoming national consultations on transitional justice i also met a number of sri lankas finest thinkers and analysts including members of its vibrant civil society organizationson sunday i visited the northern and eastern provinces where i met the chief ministers and members of the provincial councils as well as the governors and yesterday morning i was honoured to visit the revered sri dalada maligawa or temple of the sacred tooth in kandy where i was graciously received by the mahanayakas chief monks of the malwatte and asgiriya chapters i am very grateful to them for according me this great privilege as well as to the members of the hindu muslim and christian communities i met in colombo jaffna and trincomaleethis has been a much more friendly cooperative and encouraging visit than the one my predecessor endured in august which as you may recall was marred by vituperative attacks on her integrity simply because she addressed a number of burning human rights issues that any high commissioner for human rights would have raised at that timei am aware that some of the same people have given me a similar welcome ive seen the posters but i am pleased that in the new environment in sri lanka all voices including the moderate voices of civil society can at last be heard even if sometimes the voices of hatred and bigotry are still shouting the loudest and as a result are perhaps being listened to more than they deservesri lanka has come a long way in the past year as you the media are only too aware given the much greater freedom you now have to write what you wish to write and report what you feel you should report the element of fear has considerably diminished at least in colombo and the south in the north and the east it has mutated but sadly still existsvirtually everyone agrees there has been progress although opinions differ markedly about the extent of that progress the white van abductions that operated outside all norms of law and order and as intended instilled fear in the hearts of journalists human rights defenders and others who dared criticise the government or state security institutions are now very seldom reported the number of torture complaints has been reduced but new cases continue to emerge as two recent reports detailing some disturbing alleged cases that occurred in have shown and police all too often continue to resort to violence and excessive forceseveral recent highly symbolic steps have been taken that have had a positive impact on intercommunal relations including the decision taken to sing the national anthem in both sinhala and tamil on independence day for the first time since the early s the following day in a reciprocal gesture the chief minister of the northern province paid a respectful visit to a buddhist temple in jaffna and in january the president pardoned the convicted ltte prisoner who once plotted to assassinate him these are significant steps on the path of reconciliation between these two communities both of which bear their own deep scars from the years of conflict i was pleased to learn that some major inter communal events are planned in the north and east to bring together large numbers of young people from all across sri lanka in both provinces the governors are now civilians which is another key improvementone of the most important longterm achievements over the past year has been the restoration of the legitimacy and independence of sri lankas human rights commission the appointment of new leadership of great integrity through the proper constitutional process offers a new start to revitalise this allimportant national institution i hope the government will now swiftly provide it with the resources and above all the institutional respect it needs to enable it to fulfil its great potential not only to provide human rights protection for all sri lankans but also to offer expert advice on laws and policies from a human rights perspectivedespite these advances and others i have not mentioned after nearly years of conflict and acrimony that not only cost tens of thousands of lives but also eroded so many vital components of the state sri lanka is still in the early stages of renewalduring this visit i have met sinhalese muslim and tamil victims of the ruthless ltte and other paramilitary groups family members of those who were assassinated mothers of children who were abducted or recruited muslims from the north who were forcibly evicted and expelled from their homes mothers of soldiers who never returned and some of the many thousands of war widows from both sides i am all too conscious of the suffering and fear that the years of bombings killings and other abuses inflicted on this societyi also met the mothers and wives of people who were apprehended or surrendered to the security forces and then disappeared i have met relatives of people who have been in detention for years without being charged with any crime or who were charged solely on the basis of allegedly forced confessions i met one woman carrying the emotional scars of her rape by security forces nearly years ago during the jvp insurgency her pain and that of all these victims and their families is terrible to behold and it is cruel to prolong it if ways of alleviating it are availabledistracted by this conflict sri lanka has also failed to address critical issues facing women people with disabilities people with different sexual orientations and other groups suffering discrimination such as the plantation tamils in central sri lanka i hope that these and other neglected or discriminatedagainst groups and minorities will now receive the attention they deserve not least in the constitutional reform processrepairing the damage done by a protracted conflict is a task of enormous complexity and the early years are crucial if mistakes are made or significant problems are downplayed or ignored during the first few years they become progressively harder to sort out as time goes on while the glass is still molten if you are quick and skilful you can shape it into a fine object that will last for years once it starts to harden in misshapen form it becomes more and more difficult to rectify likewise if any of the four key elements of post conflict resolution truthtelling accountability reparations and institutional reform are neglected or mishandled unresolved resentments will fester new strains will emerge and a tremendous opportunity to establish longterm stability which in turn should result in greater prosperity will be lostin the case of sri lanka large parts of the country have been physically politically socially and economically separated from each other to a greater or lesser degree for much of the past three decades and the effort to rebuild trust in the state and between communities will take years of political courage determination and skilled coordination and planningwhen you visit colombo you see a bustling city a mass of construction sites clean streets and flourishing businesses you see a thriving tourist industrywhen you visit the north and the east you see in patches at least damaged and depressed areas poverty and continued displacement signs of physical development certainly and positive vision and ambitions among the elected representatives but also more ominous signs of hopes that are not yet bearing fruit and optimism that is already showing some signs of souringwhile there is much support for the very important proposed constitutional reform which should ensure that the rights of all sri lankans are fully recognised there are also fears that at a later stage this may be achieved at the expense of other equally important processes such as truthtelling justice and accountabilitywhile the task force appointed to lead the national consultation process includes high quality representatives of civil society there are concerns including among the taskforce members themselves that the process is too rushed and has not been properly planned or adequately resourcedthere are some measures that could be taken quickly which would reverse this trend of draining confidence first of all the military needs to accelerate the return of land it has seized and is still holding to its rightful owners while some land has been returned in the jaffna and trincomalee areas there are still large tracts which can and should be swiftly given back once the land has been given back the remaining communities of displaced people can if given the necessary assistance return home and a lingering sore will have been cured once and for all in parallel the size of the military force in the north and the east can be reduced to a level that is less intrusive and intimidating as a first step in security sector reformthe government must also quickly find a formula to charge or release the remaining securityrelated detainees in addition the prime ministers recent statement that nearly all the disappeared persons are dead has created great distress among their families who until then still had hope this statement must be followed by rapid action to identify precisely who is still alive and who has died or been killed properly account for their deaths including whether or not they were unlawful identify the location of their remains and provide redresshigh on the agenda in every meeting i have had here of course were issues relating to the implementation of the resolution adopted by the un human rights council on october last year a resolution that was cosponsored by sri lanka and agreed with the consensus of all member states of the council the resolution laid out an eminently sensible pathway for the country to follow and my office was charged with following up on its implementation including by reporting back to the council on progress or lack of it next june and again in march the human rights council resolution and the comprehensive report on which it was based and which it endorsed aim to promote reconciliation accountability and human rights the release of the report and the ensuing resolution unleashed a great surge of hope that finally we were all turning a corner in terms of starting to fully recognise what happened during the final years of sri lankas hugely corrosive and tragic conflictthe human rights council resolution was in many ways a reflection of the reform agenda that sri lankans had voted for in last years presidential and parliamentary elections it sets out some of the tough steps that must be taken to achieve reconciliation and accountability and through them lasting peacethere are many myths and misconceptions about the resolution and what it means for sri lanka it is not a gratuitous attempt to interfere with or undermine the countrys sovereignty or independence it is not some quasicolonial act by some nebulous foreign power the acceptance of the resolution was a moment of strength not weakness by sri lanka it was the countrys commitment to both itself and to the world to confront the past honestly and by doing that take out comprehensive insurance against any future devastating outbreak of inter communal tensions and conflictthe world wants sri lanka to be a success story it has seen the opportunity for lasting success in sri lanka and that is why it has invested so much time and energy into providing that pathway laid down in last octobers human rights council resolution i urge all sri lankans to make an effort to understand what that resolution and the report underpinning it actually say and i urge all those in a position to do so to make a greater effort to explain why the recommendations are so important and why the united nations and all those individual states sri lanka included endorsed them then perhaps the siren voices who wish to undermine all reforms all attempts to provide justice accountability and reconciliation will get less traction the people who are trying to undermine confidence in these crucial initiatives are playing a game that is endangering the future peace and stability of this countryfor a country to be stable to be a success it needs to have a strong impartial and credible justice system the security services and the judiciary must function in the interests of all its citizens and it was in these areas that the countrys key institutions were seriously corroded and corrupted during three decades of conflict and human rights violations including through its reliance on the draconian prevention of terrorism act and other emergency powers and it is the integrity of these institutions which depends on having the trust of the population that the international community is trying hard to help sri lanka restore through the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report and in the resolutionsri lanka has many excellent judges lawyers and law enforcement officials but over the years the system they depended on and which depends on them became highly politicised unbalanced unreliable the countrys history over the past few decades is littered with judicial failures virtually all sri lankans recognise this and the prime minister commented on it at great length and with admirable candour during a january debate in parliament virtually every week provides a new story of a failed investigation a mob storming a courtroom or another example of a crime going unpunished sexual violence and harassment against women and girls is particularly poorly handled by the relevant state institutions especially when the alleged perpetrators are members of the military or security services and as a result it remains all too widespreadit is for these reasons that the report and the human rights council resolution suggest international participation in the accountability mechanisms set up to deal with international crimes and gross human rights violations committed by individuals on both sides this is a practical proposal to solve the very real and practical problems i mentioned earlier but it is only one aspect albeit a very important one of the broad range of measures outlined in the un report and resolution and the extent to which it has been allowed to dominate the debate in sri lanka in recent days is unfortunate extreme nationalistic tendencies lay at the heart of sri lankas conflict and they should not be allowed to undermine the countrys long term chances of recovery once againonly a year ago large numbers of sri lankans voted for change for reconciliation for truth for justice it would be a great shame if a minority of extreme voices on both sides who are bent on disruption were allowed to prevail by creating fear where there should be hope sri lanka needs a serious debate about these very serious issues on which its future depends this needs to start with a thorough frank and honest discussion of the detailed findings of the september un report as it is important that all sri lankans rally behind the process and better understand the point of view of all the victims on all sidesthe government has shown the will to make great changes but from the victims in the north and in the east and also from some of the wisest analysts here in colombo i have heard fears that the government may be wavering on its human rights commitments i was therefore reassured this morning to hear both the president and the prime minister state their firm conviction in this regardlet me make it as plain as i can the international community wants to welcome sri lanka back into its fold without any lingering reservations it wants to help sri lanka become an economic powerhouse it wants sri lankas armed forces to face up to the stain on their reputation so that they can once again play a constructive role in international peacekeeping operations and command the full respect that so many of their members deservebut for all that to come to fruition sri lanka must confront and defeat the demons of its past it must create institutions that work and ensure accountability it must seize the great opportunity it currently has to provide all its people with truth justice security and prosperity i for my part will do all in my power to help that come about and will continue to offer the services of my office to accompany sri lanka through this very difficult processthank you

former president mahinda rajapaksa today called upon the sri lankan public to unite and resist the attempt by the government to betray the country and the war heroes following the assurance given to the un human rights commissioner that last years un human rights council resolution against sri lanka will be implemented i am profoundly saddened to see that a section slfp has also joined the unp in this great betrayalhaving accepted the geneva resolution the government is now adopting various strategies to convince the public that it will not be harmful to the country we saw the president and prime minister in recent days expressing to the international media what seemed to be contradictory views on the participation of foreign judges in the proposed war crimes mechanismfull statement released from his office as followsthe president and prime minister have given the un human rights commissioner an assurance that last years un human rights council resolution against sri lanka will be implemented this unhrc resolution was accepted and cosponsored by the sri lankan government and passed by the unhrc without a vote the unp led government accepted the geneva resolution with the same carelessness with which they entered into the ceasefire agreement with the ltte in though our ambassador in geneva tried to negotiate different terms that was deliberately stopped by the government which insisted on accepting the us sponsored resolution just as it was there is now an attempt to portray this unhrc resolution as a great diplomatic victory for sri lanka but in reality it was a great betrayal comparable to the kandyan convention of the people should once again be reminded about what exactly has been undertaken by accepting this resolution in operative paragraphs and the present government has accepted the report of the office of the high commissioner on human rights which said that war crimes including the killing of civilians torture and the deliberate starvation of people had been committed by our armed forces and they have agreed to set up a war crimes tribunal manned by foreign judges prosecutors and investigators and funded directly from overseas to try our war heroes for these alleged crimes furthermore they have agreed to remove through administrative action members of the armed forces who are suspected of having committed war crimes but against whom there isnt enough evidence to place before the war crimes tribunal they have also agreed to make amendments to the public security ordinance and to repeal the prevention of terrorism actin operative paragraphs and the government has undertaken to devolve power in order to bring about a political settlement sri lanka and to do everything undertaken in the resolution under the supervision of the office of the high commissioner on human rights ohchr it should be borne in mind that the ohchr that has come in for heavy criticism by the un human rights council itself the unhrc passes every year with more than a two thirds majority a resolution calling upon the ohchr to end the domination of that office by westerners and to reduce its dependency on western funds the government has thus agreed to place sri lanka under the supervision of an institution that is facing criticism by the unhrc itself for its western biashaving accepted the geneva resolution the government is now adopting various strategies to convince the public that it will not be harmful to the country we saw the president and prime minister in recent days expressing to the international media what seemed to be contradictory views on the participation of foreign judges in the proposed war crimes mechanism but this was just a drama for public consumption it became clear from the presidents independence day speech that there is no difference in the stands taken by him and the prime minister on the geneva resolution the president not only endorsed the decision of the government to implement the geneva resolution but also accused those opposed to it of misleading the public he further said in his independence day speech that the implementation of the geneva resolution will only result in promoting democracy reconciliation and respect for our armed forcesthe war was won by an slfp government led by me it is a matter of profound regret to me that our party has been subordinated in this manner to the unp which tried to sabotage the war effort at every turn many would recall the manner in which the unp even tried to stop the war by defeating the government at the budget vote in when that did not work members of the unp ridiculed the war effort by saying among other things that any ox can fight a war and that while claiming to be advancing on alimankada the army was actually moving towards pamankada it is not surprising to see such people now trying to exact revenge from those who won the warhowever i am profoundly saddened to see that a section slfp has also joined the unp in this great betrayal the unp may be deriving a great deal of satisfaction by thus getting a section of the slfp which won the war to underwrite every traitorous they commit i call upon the people of sri lanka to unite and resist this attempt by the government to betray the country and our war heroes
