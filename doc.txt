destination for fdi despite operating a complex and an expensive system of tax incentives to promote investment fdi remains low connectivity is also another important factor policies and investments to promote regional cooperation and integration should be a key strategic priorityfourth arun kumar says investment in growthoriented infrastructure and logistics is imperative to make sri lanka an economic hub in south asiaanother very important factor would be balancing geopolitical partnerships specifically those with china and india many countries like china india japan are seeking a greater

would be made into lead pencils that american school children would write withwalden pond became famous when henry david thoreau the philosopher wrote his book walden it turns out that thoreau worked in his family s pencil factory shaping sri lankan graphite into pencils this is to my mind a story of the connections we find in our world everyone and every country is connected in some way no man is

sept lbo sri lankan marathoner hassan esufally on a mission to earn the prestigious continents marathon club membership recently ran his firstever marathon in south america a gruelling km trail across the southern peruvian andeson his challenging journey towards becoming a continents marathon club member hassan has now completed marathons in europe asia australia africa and south americahere s what he had to say about his remarkable experience running the inca trail marathon in peru and becoming the first sri lankan to have conquered international marathons in continentstell us a little bit about your experiences in cusco the starting point of the marathon and how you felt right before you embarked on the km runthe day before the marathon we hiked km to llaqtapata a beautiful archaeological site located in the cusco region where we camped and spent the night we awoke to a am call and began to prepare for our am kickoff at this point i was having a bit of bad luck as i discovered that my hydration pack was leaking though this was quite disappointing as you can imagine i didn t let it keep me down for too long i knew i had to stay in a positive frame of mind to endure the challenges that lay ahead with the help of linda a trusty fellow runner who gave me a bottle beanie and waterproof jacket i was able to change my strategy for carrying fluids throughout the run i decided to store all of the fluids that i needed in a handheld bottle encased in a glove and attach it to my running belt that day i was reminded for the umpteenth time in my career as a marathoner that tough situations create tough peopletake us through the terrain and different stages of the marathon that you ran and tell us what it s like up there on the peruvian andeswe started the race in total darkness way before the crack of dawn with only our headlamps to light the way this was quite challenging for me given that i d never run with a headlamp before but i knew that this was only a foretaste of how much i d have to push myself beyond my comfort zone during this marathon in addition to making our way in the rugged and craggy terrain we were faced with the most extreme and varying weather conditions ranging from harsh winds and snow to heavy rains and sunshine after daybreak the weather took on a drastic shift from cold and dark to hot and humid making our hardest uphill section dead woman s pass all the more gruelling arriving at the lush rainforests of the amazon basin we geared up for what we knew would be the toughest section of the entire trail a ft climbduring the climb we experienced a sharp drop in temperatures with thick layers of snow and ice posing a new challenge to us all i took a couple of minutes to change my gearand brace myself against the freezing cold weather and with a fresh burst of determination i prepared myself to withstand the demanding highaltitude conditionsthe entire first half of the marathon was full of varying degrees of uphill and downhill slopes so i adapted a strategy of walking through the uphill areas and sprinting through the downhill areas as i am a much better downhill runner than an uphill runner at the halfway mark of the race i broke away from a fellow runner melissa and picked up speed in order to make the time cutoff for the winaywayna gate passing through the winaywayna gate onto the sun gate we got our first glimpse of the breathtakingly beautiful th century inca site machu picchu which meant that the end for us was in sight as well at this juncture i knew that the hardest part of the race was over and i could enjoy the last few miles really taking in every glorious vista and sound on the hike to machu picchuwhat are some of the personal challenges you faced over the course of the marathon and how did you cope with themas is the case with all highaltitude terrains one of the most predictable challenges of this marathon for me was the extremely low air pressure which made breathing very difficult however having trained intensely for many months with my highaltitude mask on i was wellacclimated to withstand the acutely thin air atop the andes moreover by the halfway point of the marathon i had twisted my ankles for a grand total of ten times five times on each leg by this time my legs and entire body were so sore but in spite of it all i summoned up all the strength and stamina in me to race against time and make the cutoff for the winaywayna gatearound an hour before the gate cutoff my watch died leaving me to run and track my speed on instinct i reached the final aid station at puyupatamarca and left behind all my extra layers of clothing there in order to be as light as possible for what was to be the most taxing stretch yet the race director had instructed me that those who usually make the gate cutoff get to the final aid station with hours left to go and i just had one this realization struck me like a bullet and with new found energy i galloped at top speed to make the cutall while praying to god and recalling memories of my grandfather and high priest to draw inspiration despite running on instinct with no way of calculating my pace and repeatedly twisting and spraining my ankles while running through the treacherous downhill sections i believed that i would make the cutoff and i did with just two minutes to sparetell us a little bit about the memorable experiences and encounters that you had along the waydespite the first half of the trail being quite challenging in its own right i really enjoyed this part of the marathon thanks to the amazing company of fellow marathoner melissa who ran alongside me through the rough stretches we took some great pictures of the captivating sights and scenery en route exchanged food and shared stories all the way to keep each other going at the third pass of runkurakay where there was a steep uphill ascent a kind english family lent me a pair of their walking sticks to help with the ft climb ahead another experience that i distinctly remember and treasure it was really encouraging to see how the hikers and holidaymakers on the inca trail were very respectful and thoughtful towards the marathon runners always giving us preference on the coursemy most memorable moments and experiences from the inca trail marathon i d have to say were when i first entered through the sun gate and set eyes on the mighty machu picchu fortress it was profoundly relieving and rewarding to be standing up there soaking up the beauty and glory of this lost ancient city on my way to the sun gate i saw a vibrant rainbow beaming ahead as if to welcome and reward us for all the tireless effort that we had put in to get there whilst taking in the scenery i radioed my wife rashida to let her know that i was just minutes away from the finish line i had tears in my eyes when she told me that she had been waiting for me atop machu picchu for over four hours by that time i couldn t wait to run down the last mile and a half to go and see herall in all what do you have to say about your remarkable achievement in south america and what did itfeel like to be out there representing your countryaon a personal level the inca trail marathon was more than just a race it was a oneofakind lifechanging experience i count myself extremely lucky and blessed to have had the chance to see firsthand and run atop this magnificent citadel running past the finish line of what is considered to be the world s toughest marathon with the sri lankan flag hoisted high above my shoulders is a moment that will forever stay ingrained in my heart and mind the average person would take three nights and four days to complete a marathon of this nature to have finished it in just hours gave me a profound boost of confidence and it made me realize that i have truly grown and improved as a professional marathon runner

potential for sri lankathe full text of the speech follows remarks made by hon mangala samaraweera minister of finance and media at the opening of the tourist vat refund scheme tvrs at the bia on th september it is a pleasure to address you at this important and highly anticipated event it is always satisfying to witness proposals from the budget coming to fruitionwe speak a lot about the importance of improving tax collection in sri lanka this has been one of the biggest challenges faced by our government and i am pleased to note that we have made important improvements in tax collection and compliance this will help our objectives of servicing outstanding debt repayments but a lot more needs to be doneat the same time we are acutely aware of the importance of ensuring that taxation is fair convenient and as nondistortive as possibleto this end the government will always give priority to the development of strategic industries however this will be done in a rules based manner as opposed to adhoc incentives that have led to corruption and tax leakage in the pastin the inland revenue act itself we have provided significant concessions to sectors including tourism exports it education and agriculture all of which are taxed at corporate income tax this is in addition to the attractive capital allowances which provide a major tax break for new investmentsthe tourist vat refund scheme is a budget proposal which will provide a significant boost for the tourism sector and the retail sector the tvrs will enable sri lankan goods to have greater exposure to the global market bringing with it several positive economic spill oversvat is an end user consumption tax and therefore should not be applied to goods and services that are consumed outside of sri lanka by introducing such a tvr scheme sri lanka will be aligning itself with international best practicesneighbouring countries including thailand and singapore have become regional shopping centres and utilising vatfree shopping has been an impetus to this year around tourists would visit increasingly for the sole purpose of shopping and international retailers have as a result invested heavily in these countries sri lanka has similar potential to exploit such opportunities particularly considering its significant tourism assets over above shopping and retailthe tvrs has a particular importance for enhancing the attraction of colombo as a destination today most tourists tend to bypass colombo for attractions outside of the capital city but with the opportunity for vat free shopping tourists will have more reason to spend time in colombo trends in other cities show that tourists that visit destinations for the sole purpose of shopping tend to spend significantly more than their counterparts that visit the rest of the country and they tend to stay at the destination longer than traditional tourists therefore i believe that this would be the first step in unlocking a major potential for sri lankathe tvrs could also have benefits in terms of enhancing tax compliance more firms will be incentivised to register to claim the privileges thus improving formalisation of the economy this scheme would also give the tax administration a greater insight to retail and tourism sectorsi expect the tvrs to provide a significant incentive for luxury retail operators in sri lanka there are already a number of shopping destinations with major global brands beginning to establish in sri lanka and this trend can only benefit and further expand with the tourist vat refund mechanism we look forward to seeing enhanced investments from this sectorsince this is a new initiative we may experience some initial teething issues in implementation but i expect the officers of the ird will take diligent measures to bring the system up to global standards within a very short period of time by adopting the best available technology and expertiseimproving the environment for sri lankan businesses has always been a priority for the government of sri lanka by implementing policies such as this we expect material benefits to accrue to the tourism industry the retail sector and the wider economy through indirect benefitsi thank everyone who has been involved in the implementation of this project specially commissioner general mr ivan dissanayake who will be retiring in a

of the alibaba partnership and our board of directors i also want to offer special thanks to all alibaba colleagues and your families because your trust support and our joint enterprise over the past years have prepared us for this day with confidence and strengththis transition demonstrates that alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals to one built on systems of organizational excellence and a culture of talent developmentwhen alibaba was founded in our goal was to build a company that could make china and the world proud and one that could cross three centuries to last years however we all knew that no one could stay with the company for years a sustainable alibaba would have to be built on sound governance culturecentric philosophy and consistency in developing talent no company can rely solely on its founders of all people i should know that because of physical limits on one s ability and energy no one can shoulder the responsibilities of chairman and ceo foreverwe asked ourselves this question years ago how could alibaba achieve sustainable growth after jack ma leaves the company we believed the only way to solve the problem of corporate leadership succession was to develop a system of governance based on a unique culture and mechanisms for developing consistent talent and successors for the last years we kept working on these ingredientshaving been trained as a teacher i feel extremely proud of what i have achieved teachers always want their students to exceed them so the responsible thing to do for me and the company to do is to let younger more talented people take over in leadership roles so that they inherit our mission to make it easy to do business anywhere carrying out this mission in order to help small businesses young people and women around the world is my passion this is not only our intent from day one but i feel blessed to have this opportunity to realize the

system and efforts to safeguard our culture will in time win over the love and support from customers employees and shareholderssince the founding of the company in we have been of the view that

sept lbo in the wake of continuing uncertainty with regard to the effective date on the reintroduction of value added tax vat on residential condominiums realestate consulting agency jones lang lasalle jll released a new report analyzing the likely impact of impending policy changes on the sri lankan real estate sectorfollowing the announcement of amendments to the value added tax act no of amendment act no of certified by the speaker on august and the termination of the exemption of vat on the supply of residential accommodation other than lease or rent it would appear that all sales of condominium properties in sri lanka over million rupees now attract vat at percent of the sale price in addition to stamp duty and nbt effective from august however the report noted that the industry is currently rife with speculation that further government announcements may clarify the effective date of imposition as april this only adds to confusion over government policy and fuels industry wide gloom compounded by a lack of clarity and consistency from policy makers while it is difficult to find anyone who welcomes the removal of the exemption and therefore imposition of vat on residential sales with immediate effect equally history tells us that a fake gold rush of sales to beat the deadline if april is confirmed followed by a dramatic fall off afterwards is just as unwelcome the report notedin that context jll noted that the fact that such major changes to fundamental policies continued to proceed in fits and starts has thrown further doubt over proceedings and reduced transparency as to the intended outcomes of these policies and to what extent the industry s varied stakeholder considerations had impacted policy is the vat levy purely a revenue gathering exercise or an attempt to manipulate the market by dampening demand in the higher reaches of the condominium market and if so why this confusion undermines confidence and confidence is the key to any market be that real estate or any other product so if the intention is to raise revenue the vat measure is counterproductive and if it is intended to dampen demand when absorption rates for luxury condominiums currently averages in colombo why would the government want to see stalled development projects and vacant development plots littering the colombo environment the report queriedeven if in the alternative the government s unstated aim with these policy amendments was to concentrate developer focus on low cost and social housing for social policy reasons jll warned that continuing policy uncertainty would only create barriers to the commercial development of such properties when combined with continuing land price speculation and a serious gap in public transport infrastructureregional experiences in taxing real estate in order to shed more light on the likely impact of this impending shift in taxation policy jll drew parallels to the experiences of other countries in the asean region that had recently imposed rafts of real estate taxes while the report acknowledged the significant variance in relation to underlying rationale in other geographies jll nevertheless emphasized the value of such comparison particularly given that the most prominent rationale for such moves as in sri lanka had been to rein in rampant market growth while promoting socio economic policyin that regard the report noted that the indonesian government introduced a revised luxury tax of on units over idr billion in resulting in weak sales and subdued market conditions in the luxury sector impacting both new unit launches and resulting salesin jakarta in units were released for sale and sales numbered in only new units were launched and sales slumped to some transactions a fall of and respectively while sentiments are predicted to remain subdued with flat or falling prices on both primary and secondary markets especially given that the indonesian market is heavily skewed to local demand although the population of the urban municipality of jakarta exceeds million and the market dynamics differ to colombo these statistics may correlate closely to condominium sales in the commercial capital as of demand originates from sri lankan residents and ex pats the report notedsimilar yet more conservative measures were also adopted in malaysia through the introduction of a goods and services tax on land sales and construction materialsservices which in turn resulted in a rise in unit prices in the luxury sector even this relatively small increase in taxation caused subdued conditions in the highend condominium market with developers scaling back on new property launches amid continued weak demandmeanwhile in the philippines a different agenda was adopted with a view to shifting policy away from direct to indirect taxation in an effort to reduce poverty and increase middle income status a vat levy was imposed on luxury condominiums together with significant incentives for the development of low cost housing projectsthis saw a shift towards affordable projects unlike sri lanka however these transitions were explicitly stated by the government at the very outset providing the industry a clear direction to follow it remains to be seen how the market in sri lanka reacts to the new announcement and subsequent imposition of vat on condominium sales whether in august or april but even when making allowances for differing agendas and demographics the above examples demonstrate that changes in property taxation regimes when not linked to clear policy goals result in confusion and a steep decline in activity this makes identifying any particular beneficiaries under any new regime a real challenge in effect the government has targeted the sector in isolation where a multifaceted approach is what is called for in doing so sri lanka risks missing the opportunity to foster controlled property sector growth and increased fdi as the country continues to emerge on to the global investment stage as one of the last remaining prospects for genuine growth in the entire region the report notedin that regard jll called for the development of a policy framework that would be more conducive to the functioning of a robust property sector underpinned by local and international demandthis would in turn make significant contributions to an expanding and open economy with trickle down effects such as employment prospects increased personal spending tourist arrivals and improved infrastructure and utility provision to the benefit of the entire population 
cigarettes are one of the most smuggled legal products in the world and cigarette smuggling is a form of transnational organized crime us department of state evidence shows many highprofile terrorist organizations such as alqaida etc operate smuggling rings due to higher profit margins and relatively lower riskus department of state with sri lanka having one of the highest cigarette prices in the region it has led the country into the hands of illegal cigarette smugglers who make huge profits this trend consistent tax hikes from have since given way to large and unprecedented hike in which hampered the objectives of both the ministry of health and the ministry of financehigh taxes play a significant role in incentivising the smuggling of cigarettes the research intelligence unit s report on towards sensible policy reforms to combat illicit tobacco markets said in the context of sri lanka the price differential between legal and illicit is about rs per stick for cigarettes and about rs per stick for beedi it says while the distribution of illicit cigarettes is much easier and organized than drugs such as heroineillicit tobacco market estimating the size of the current illicit tobacco market is a crucial step towards benchmarking and assessing the effectiveness of actions to curb the growth of the market since the illicit market is not directly observable for multifarious reasons an indirect approach was required to estimate the size of the market as per the analysis the illicit market share is around to for cigarettes and to for beedi which translate to to million sticks of cigarettes and to million sticks of beedi in in other words the illicit cigarette market turnover could be anywhere between rs to billion which is about to of the legitimate market size while illicit beedi market is worth rs to billion which is about to of the legitimate market this massive size of the illicit market means loss of revenue for the government to the industry and for those whose livelihoods are connected with tobacco industry such as tobacco farmers and beedi rollers in addition to the above it can be observed that the size of the illicit market has risen to or more by this calls into question the government s policy towards the industry and the efficiency of the enforcement agenciesriu says there is strong evidence to suggest higher taxes are a key reason for increased smuggling levels in sri lanka over the years there is a reduction in legitimate cigarette sales while the consumption of beedi has been going up this indicates the consumers are switching to beedi as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes this took place in the backdrop of a continually increasing excise tax environment therefore it can be concluded that high taxes have a strong connection with the illicit tobacco tradeaccording to the authorities and other sources met during this research a foot container of smuggled cigarettes can add up to a profit of between rs millionriu this softer penalty makes the risks associated with smuggling highly acceptable to criminalshowever the who refutes the claim that higher taxes lead to higher smuggling and states that the link between price and tax differences and largescale illicit trade is weak rather the evidence shows that other enabling factors are more important the enabling factors according to who arepopulation perceptions and social economic statushowever a recent study done in us found that there is a correlation between the illicit market share and the tax ratestax foundation the study further statespublic policies often have unintended consequences that outweigh their benefits one consequence of high state cigarette tax rates has been increased smuggling as people procure discounted packs from lowtax states to sell in hightax states growing cigarette tax differentials have made cigarette smuggling both a national problem and in some cases a lucrative criminal enterprise figure illustrates how smuggled cigarettes move from low tax jurisdictions to high tax jurisdictions in the us the data points green dots represent the illicit share in each state negative data points indicate outflows while positive data points indicate inflows when a trend line dotted red line is drawn it is trending upwards therefore it is evident that as the cigarette excise tax rate increases horizontal axis the cigarette smuggling as a percentage of consumption rises vertical axisthe illicit tobacco trade has resulted in huge losses to the governments in the form of loss of taxes building on the analysis in figure riu calculated the revenue loss to the government from illicit tobacco the loss figures were arrived at by using the extrapolation of income from legitimate tobacco sales to put things into perspective the government has spent close to rs billion for the samurdhi programme last yearthe loss of tax revenue from illicit tobacco is equivalent to to of the annual samurdhi spending therefore if converted to legitimate sales the government could have spent this revenue on productive economic or social activitiespress release

by devaka wickramasuriyai have read with much interest the recent article where dr romesh bandaranaike has shared his unique perspective of sri lanka s plantationsat the outset i totally disagree with dr bandaranaike s contention that privatization was necessary as the plantations were the biggest source of political patronage in the country while some political interference did exist this was not of any magnitude whereby the administration and or management of the plantations were seriously affected or virtually paralyzed as insinuateddr bandaranaike appears to have conveniently forgotten that during the period his excellency j r jayawardena was president of sri lanka the sri lanka state plantations corporation slspc and the janatha estates development board jedb were directly under his purview and thereafter under the purview of gentlemen of the caliber of mr gamini dissanayake and general ranjan wijeratne who were the ministers of plantation industries it would be obvious to all that none of these gentlemen would have permitted undue political influence which would have affected the administration and or management of the plantations to have been prevalentdr bandaranaike appears to be ignorant of the situation that affected the industry as well as the country at that time up to around the two organizations fared well but since were affected by a severe decline in world market prices to add to these woes plantations were probably the worst affected with the insurrection in the country following the signing of the indosri lanka peace accord in numerous factories were burnt many planters estate staff and workers were brutally murdered for no other reason other than refusing to accede to the demands of the insurgents yet they steadfastly continued to perform their duties amidst all odds and safeguarded the assets of estates which were in their custody the armed insurrection also resulted in the stoppage of work on estates for extended periods of time on occasions even up to months with workers returning for work only after they were provided the necessary protection to do sothe problems detailed in the preceding paragraph naturally resulted in a serious drop in revenue to both the slspc and jedb however both the slspc jedb rose magnificently to the occasion and despite their revenues dropping drastically continued to pay the staff and workers even though at times no work was performed by them purely to ensure their existence as well as continued to supply them with basic foodstuffs which were in very short supply in the plantation districts the situation that existed was so serious that there was an instance that cash for workers wages for estates in the badulla district had to be airlifted to badulla as all banks in the uva district were not functioning it must be reiterated that hardly any planters estate staff or workers abandoned post but continued to perform their duties to the best of their ability despite their lives being continually in danger due to the volatile situation that prevailed it was this dedication displayed by the planters estate staff and workers that ensured an industry was yet in existence at the end of the insurrection many of those who resided in the comparative safety of cities such as dr bandaranaike may not have been aware or probably were not interested in what the planters estate staff and workers were harrowingly subjected to during this periodthis volatile situation continued till early after which began a time of rebuilding the morale of the planters staff and workers reconstruction of the buildings destroyed and the resumption of the agricultural practicesdevelopment which had been severely disrupted it would be necessary to emphasize that all of this could not be done overnight and took around months to completearound this time rumors of privatization were in the air and i quote below an extract of the speech made by the then minister of plantation industries mr ranjan wijeratne as chief guest at the th annual general meeting of the ceylon planters society in september where he refuted the rumors of privatization we don t have management skills in colombo to manage the plantations anymore they have to be built up from grassroots i am not prepared to hand over the plantations to whittalls george steuarts carsons and so forth they are all dead ducks now so we have to create new ducks and i have given the opportunity to a set of regional board directors to prove their mettle after three years we will make an assessment of their work and if it is possible for us to rely on them as private sector managers then management will be privatized and given to you all and not outsiders we don t require foreigners expatriates to come and manage our plantations it is a disgrace it is we who went to indonesia and resurrected the indonesian plantations there is no need to bring foreigners here i was told that foreign elements were waiting to barge into the plantations to manage them never will i allow them to come this way we have the skills here and we shall throw up the real leaders to be the private sector managers of the plantations therefore based on mr wijeratne s views which he expressed as the minister of plantation industries it is evident that he was not in agreement with plantations being privatizedit would also be necessary to state that the chairman and directors of the slspc and jedb central and regional boards were planters who had worked on private sector managed plantations prior to nationalization in and were appointed to these posts purely on their ability and dedication as planters therefore it would be evident that the ministers in charge of the slspc and jedb as well the chairmen directors of the central regional boards of the organizations were highly respected and dedicated personalities who successfully resisted all attempts of excessive political interference if dr bandaranaike disagrees with my contention i hope he will name those who in his opinion was not suitable to hold the posts they heldunfortunately mr ranjan wijeratne was assassinated on nd march and once again the rumors of privatization of plantations became rampant with privatization eventually becoming a reality in june the main reason for privatization of plantations as stated by the government of the day was to relieve themselves of the burden of managing the massive industry they were the single largest plantation owner and manager in the world as well as to reintroduce private sector management styles and dynamism which were prevalent and were extremely successful in the prenationalization era back to the plantation industry therefore dr bandaranaike s contention that the management was not allowed to operate freely and were often forced to hire political appointees transfers and disciplinary actions were also frequently interrupted resulting in that even when people were caught being crooked they were still retained and also that numerous individuals with influence were attempting to profit off these plantations and encroachments on these lands were becoming the norm are baseless distorted and in any event furthest from the truth further with the government consisting of the very same politicians whom dr bandaranaike refers to as those who were subjecting the plantations to much political interference and were attempting to profit off these plantations i doubt these politicians would have agreed to the privatization of plantations if there was even the slightest iota of truth in what dr bandaranaike has stated in fact what dr bandaranaike has stated is indeed an insult to all those ministers chairmen directors planters estate staff and workers who served the industry at that time which they did with dedication and much personal sacrifice to life and limbi can state with conviction that plantations in the country were in excellent condition with muchneeded development such as replanting infilling of vacancies factory modernization being done therefore the plantations that were subjected to privatization were in excellent condition and probably needed only minor finetuning necessary to make them extremely profitable venturesdespite this being the case bureaucracy prevailed and the privatization of plantations proceeded as planned the plantations restructuring unit pru was established to handle all matters on the privatization of plantations with dr bandaranaike as its chief executive officer and public face in the whole exercisethe pru initially created regional plantation companies rpcs consisting of estates of the slspc and jedb some estates of the slspc in the kandy matale district and the jedb in the kandy district were excluded as these estates which had previously been managed by the usawasama and other cooperative societies were not considered suitable for privatization and remained with the slspc and jedbinterested companies were requested to forward their expressions of interest to manage these rpcs initially for a period of five years and in june the pru selected companies from amongst those who had responded to which the rpcs were handed overjohn keells limited a leading corporate conglomerate in sri lanka too had expressed their interest to manage rpcs in fact the interest john keells had in the management of plantations was so great that one year prior to the actual privatization taking place they recruited a very senior respected efficient and dedicated planter who was chairman of a regional board of the jedb to set up their plantations division despite all this john keells was rejected for no conceivable reason i hope dr romesh dias bandaranaike who headed the pru at that time can enlighten us on how this catastrophe occurred and whether it was politically motivatedin july the pru created a rd rpc this rpc comprised of estates of the slspc in the matale region which had been found unsuitable for privatization just one year earlier in june two divisions of kallebokke estate an estate not included in the rd rpc consisting of mature eucalyptus timber valued at over rs billion were divested from kallebokke estate and included in this rd rpc the management of this rpc was handed over to a subsidiary of the metropolitan group for a period of five years without following the procedure adopted previously in selecting managing agents it is hoped that dr romesh dias bandaranayke will enlighten all on the necessity to create this rd rpc especially when its estates were considered not suitable to be included in any rpc one year earlier why the very valuable eucalyptus extents were divested from kallebokke estate and included with this rpc and why a managing agent was chosen without adhering to the procedure followed earlier in the selection of managing agentsthe land on the rpcs continued to be owned by the slspc and jedb which would be evident in that the indentures of lease signed with the rpcs were signed on behalf of the slspc and jedb by directors of the respective organizationsit would also be interesting to know whether the boards of the slspc and jedb had in fact resolved that their directors sign such indentures of lease on the conditions stipulated in such indentures of lease as the concessionary conditions provided to rpcs in the indentures of lease were not available to the slspc and jedb the owners of the estates prior to or even after privatization in fact if such concessions were available to the slspc and jedb prior to privatization there would have been no necessity for the organizations to obtain any financial support from the treasury which was another reason given by dr bandaranaike as to why privatization was necessaryin three years after the management of plantations had been privatized managing agents who had run the rpcs assigned to them profitably were given the option of purchasing a stake amounting to shares at the par value of rs no investigation whatsoever was done by the pru headed by dr romesh dias bandaranaike as to whether the profit declared by these rpcs had been derived through the reduction of inputs stripping of assets or any other extraordinary circumstances that resulted in such profitsbe that as it may if my memory is correct seven rpcs were identified as profit makers and of the shares of these rpcs amounting to shares were offered to the managing agents at the par value of rs per share the income the gosl derived on this sale was rs millionthe first two profitmaking rpcs in which a controlling interest was sold to the managing agents were bogowantalawa plantations limited whose managing agents was a subsidiary of the metropolitan group and kotagala plantations limited whose managing agents were a subsidiary of george steuart sgeorge steuart s having purchased the controlling interest of kotagala plantations for a mere rs million sold virtually overnight its entire shareholding in kotagala plantations to a malaysian investor at a profit reported being around rs million dr bandaranaike would be aware of the exact amount for which kotagala plantations was sold the malaysian investorit is also surprising or should i say shocking that the share and debenture certificates on the sale of the controlling stake of kotagala plantations which should have been handed over to george steuart s were handed over personally by dr romesh dias bandaranaike to a ms mary ong supposedly the wife of the malaysian investor apparently on the request of representatives of george steuarts who had been present at the ceremony it is also a matter for much concern that dr bandaranaike with the intelligence that he possesses did not realize that things did not seem to be right when he was requested to hand over the certificates by the representatives of george steuarts to an unknown entity such as ms ong when in fact he should have handed them over to george steuart s who had made the required payments the ceremony had been photographed and a photograph of dr bandaranaike handing over the certificates to ms mary ong even appeared in the pressit is also pertinent to state that mr scott direckze when interviewed on george steuart s resale of kotagala plantations his response had been we had longstanding liabilities which we were able to settle with these funds when the government nationalized plantations we lost percent of our business and we had a very difficult time after this we received no compensation at the time recently we also suffered due to the central bank bomb we were not insured against terrorist acts we were also not covered against consequential loss therefore while it would be obvious that kotagala plantations was sold at a price much lesser than it was worth with mr scott direckze s response above indicating the poor financial state of george steuart s leaves one to wonder whether george steuart s should have even been considered suitable to be awarded a management contract to manage an rpcconfirmation of all that stated above is available in the article headed kotagala capers published in the sunday times of th june available on the link given below commencing with the article ong issue a simple explanation had i been asked romesh hits out and the further information available by clicking on continue to the newscomments page which appears at the bottom left corner of the first page httpwwwsundaytimeslk newsmhtmlthe shares of kotagala plantations purchased by the malaysian investor were subsequently resold to lankem ceylon again at a profit of some rs million based on these sales it would be evident that the correct value of kotagala plantations was around rs which was the price paid by the eventual purchaser lankemthe nonprofit making rpcs were not offered to the managing agents on concessionary terms as in the case of the profitmaking rpcs and their shares were offered for sale on the colombo stock exchange realizing an average of around rs per shareall this will indicate that the pru headed by dr romesh dias bandaranaike having sold the seven profitmaking rpcs for a total price of rs million based on rs per share caused a massive loss to the government of sri lanka gosl as based on the price for which kotagala plantations was eventually sold to lankem and the average price per share realized for the non profitmaking rpcs with their sale on the colombo stock exchange the shares in the profitmaking rpcs would also have attracted at least rs per share based on this the resultant loss to the gosl would amount to approximately rs billionthe rpcs were handed over to the lessee s debt free and the indentures of lease signed between the slspc jedb and the lessee srpcs gave concessions to them never heard of in any privatization venture two of which arebased on the concessions above it is surprising that the pru headed by dr bandaranaike who was instrumental in drafting and finalizing the indentures of lease appears to have completely overlooked the fact that all the assets of an rpc yet continued to be owned by the slspc or jedb as well as that the concessions given to the rpcs were not available to the slspc and jedb prior to or even after privatization i also wish to refer to that stated by dr romesh dias bandaranayake after some years of private management on a profit share basis without direct investment it became clear that the private sector needed to invest its own funds into the estates to get the best out of them i am indeed surprised that dr bandaranaike appears to be completely unaware of or chooses to be unaware that the private sector has not invested its own funds into the plantations in fact all funds used in the management of estates were obtained by using the concessions available to the private managers in the indentures of lease and as per details in their last annual reports are a staggering rs billionit would also be necessary to point out that some lessees have borrowed funds pledging the assets of the rpc as security and invested these funds in ventures at times even overseas when the rpc itself was struggling for existence most of these ventures have failed resulting in these investments being written off thereby resulting in the rpc having to bear the loss of these failed investmentsthe indentures of lease between rpc and the slspc or jedb besides the unbelievable concessions given to the lessee s also had no clear standard specified in them on how the rpc should be managedmaintained this has resulted in vast extents of cultivated land being abandoned replanting of tea having virtually come to a halt no infilling of vacancies being done soil conservation practices such as draining forgotten and other basic necessary agricultural practices such as forking and application of fertilizer not being done in some rpcs further the maintenance of assets such as factories bungalows other buildings and vehicles are deplorable here again in some rpcsi would also refer to the views of mr nihal sri amarasekera contained in pages to of his memorandum privatization of previously nationalized plantations available on the link httpsbooksgooglelkbooksidksirhkigdecpgpa lpgpa mr amarasekera has not only confirmed that stated by me on the profitmaking rpcs being given preferential treatment and the kotagala deal but also stated numerous other irregularities that prevailed in the privatization of the plantationsdr romesh dias bandaranaike continued with the pru and subsequently the plantation management monitoring division pmmd until st december when his contract expired and was not renewed by the then minister of plantation industries mr ratnasiri wickramanayakeit is ironical that dr romesh dias bandaranaike was thereafter employed by the metropolitan group initially as chief executive officer of their hydro power subsidiary eco power pvt limited and also as a director of metropolitan resource holdings the owning company of bogowantalawa plantations as well as bogowantalawa plantations until april confirmation of dr bandaranaike having served as a director of metropolitan resource holdings and bogowantalawa plantations is available on the link httpwwwislandlk business htmlfrom that stated previously it would be evident that the metropolitan group was afforded preferential treatment in being awarded the management contract of the rd rpc created in july to which the very valuable timber extents of kallebokke estate had been included as well as the rpc they were awarded the management of in june bogowantalawa plantations being among the first rpcs in which the controlling interest was sold on preferential termstherefore with such preferential treatment extended to the metropolitan group by the pru of which dr romesh dias bandaranaike was chief executive officer one wonders whether dr bandaranaike taking up employment with the metropolitan group was ethical further this could also lead to insinuations in the light of the preferential treatment given by the pru to the metropolitan groupdespite the many flaws that existed in the process of privatization of plantations as detailed above and for which dr romesh dias bandaranayake as chief executive officer of the pru would be responsible he is today a member of the plantations reforms committee established by the present government to identify the shortcomings prevalent in the management of rpcs though this committee had arranged for both an agricultural audit to be done on some estates of each rpc and a financial audit done on each rpc itself the reports of these audits have yet to be publicized while it is strange that these reports not being made public as yet i will not be surprised if the delays are due to irregularities on the part of some rpcs being highlighted in these reports it is hoped that at least dr bandaranaike who is bound to have copies of these reports makes them public so that all would be aware of their contentswith the exercise of privatization of plantations leaving much to be desired and even resulting in a loss of revenue to the state amounting to a staggering rs billion by the arbitrary sale of the profitmaking rpcs it is hoped that at least at this very late stage a presidential commission of inquiry is appointed to go into every aspect of the privatization of plantations and those found guilty of irresponsibility abuse of authority unethical or dubious behavior and dishonesty are suitably dealt with according to the laws of the landi would also wish to emphatically state that my desire is not to see the plantations brought back under state control but to ensure this industry which is so essential for sri lanka is placed in the hands of efficient private sector managers who will effectively manage and develop the industry to attain and even surpass its obvious potential so that both they and the country would benefit this has in fact been successfully achieved by some lessees of rpcs so farin conclusion i wish to state that i considered this response necessary as the procedure adopted in the privatization of plantations even resulting in a colossal loss of revenue to the gosl should not be allowed to be swept under the carpet and forgotten slanted or mischievously misconstruedthe writer was a planter and a superintendent with the slspc in at the time of the initial stage of privatization he was also at that time deputy president of the ceylon planters society and was actively involved in the identification and resolution of issues planters of both the slspc and jedb could have faced after privatization he also served as general manager plantations of carsons agro services limited a company that was selected to manage plantations in the st

sept lbo leveraging the tradeinvestment nexus will enable sri lanka to create high value jobs and attract technology to drive productivity growth and real wage growth for citizens the finance minister says in addition to enabling market access it is also essential to address the supply side bottlenecks for investors mangala samaraweera finance minister said at a forum organised by the postgraduate institute of management alumni association pimaa significant steps have been taken to improve the ease of doing business in sri lanka particularly through the use of technology in administrative processes last week he said the online construction permit platform was launched significantly cutting down the time and cost to obtain construction permitsthe online company registration platform was implemented to register a company within hours all of these measures will significantly reduce investment costs he added we have undertaken crucial reforms to entrench long term macroeconomic stability fiscal stabilisation has historically been a major challenge for sri lanka the full text of the speech is reproduced belowremarks by mangala samaraweera minister of finance and media at the ceos forum organised by the postgraduate institute of management alumni association pimaa at the kingsbury hotel colombolet me first of all thank you for inviting me to address you today i want to share some thoughts with you on the important and timely topic development landscape of sri lanka in fact had any of you the opportunity to visit the first enterprise sri lanka exhibition in moneragala you would have had the opportunity to get an overview of the government s vision in recent times in sri lanka the perception of development has become somewhat unclear development has become associated with ports airports expressways power plants and other mega infrastructure initiativesif a port is built which does not generate economic activity or an airport that does not attract any commercial flights it may increase the gdp but that cannot be considered developmentdevelopment to define succinctly is the process by which a nation improves the economic political and social wellbeing of its peoplei believe for a country to develop the two most important pillars on development that must be achieved are democracy and for a country like sri lanka with a history of ethnic tensions the pillar of reconciliationwhilst there is a lot to be said about the gains in political freedom of citizens as well as the governments commitment to create a truly multiethnic multi religious country united in its diversity i will focus today only on economic developmentfor this purpose the primary barometers for economic well being would be real wage growth and full employmentin today s context sri lanka no longer enjoys labour cost advantages since we have relatively high income levels this is indeed a good thing we also no longer have the fiscal space to invest public funds in large infrastructure projectsto illustrate this fact in the year government tax revenue was rs billion whilst total debt service payment in was rs billionin the years between and the average annual debt service payment was rs billion compared to the annual debt service payment in has doubledthis year records the highest debt repayment since independence approximately rs trillion nearly from the pre eratherefore it is clear that the government needs to undertake more difficult and challenging reforms in order to drive future economic growth and developmentthis entails improving the competitiveness of the economy so that output per employee is higher and this would be reflected in higher real wages the challenge remains as to how does a government improve the competitiveness of the economyin order to drive competitiveness it is necessary for economic resources to be diverted into activities that optimise output per worker this requires a shift of economic activity into sectors where sri lanka is globally competitive and move out of sectors where we cannot competein agriculture for instance we all know that approximately of the labour force accounts for around of gdpby protecting uncompetitive agriculture we are in effect trapping farmers in low wage economic activity it is clear that we need to gradually shift into higher value agriculture in order to improve output per farmer and thus income per farmerto get there we need investment and technology both fdi and domestic private investment this same principle applies to all economic sectors many of which are uncompetitive but have been protected stifling competition innovation and real wage growth whilst imposing high costs of protection on consumersit is in this context that the government has embarked on a shift in the economic trajectory of sri lanka from a protected domestic market driven economy to a more outward oriented economythe future of our economic growth must be through exports entrepreneurship fdi and private enterprisesri lanka needs private investment creating jobs in globally competitive sectors we have in the past been successful in sectors such as apparel and ict but this needs to be expanded in many more sectorsin order to unlock the potential of the economy we are implementing an economic programme that includes gradual liberalisation of the economy to attract private investment and instill more competition but whilst providing a safety net for those adversely affected by competitionwhilst gradually phasing out paratariffs to encourage competition and reduce cost of living we have already passed antidumping and safeguards legislation to protect against unfair trade practicesthe government has also designed a trade adjustment programme that will provide the tools to reskill workers and provide concessionary finance to help firms affected by competition to enhance their competitivenessat the same time a series of trade agreements are being negotiated to enhance market access to attract investment into sectors of higher productivity taking advantage of sri lanka s strategic geographic locationthe eu gsp has already provided a major boost to export market access and the ongoing negotiations with india and china will further strengthen our country as an investment destinationleveraging the tradeinvestment nexus will enable sri lanka to create high value jobs and attract technology to drive productivity growthand real wage growth for citizensin addition to enabling market access it is also essential to address the supply side bottlenecks for investors significant steps have been taken to improve the ease of doing business in sri lanka particularly through the use of technology in administrative processeslast week the online construction permit platform was launched significantly cutting down the time and cost to obtain construction permits the online company registration platform was implemented to register a company within hours all of these measures will significantly reduce investment costswe haveundertaken crucial reforms to entrench long term macroeconomic stability fiscal stabilisation has historically been a major challenge for sri lankathe passage of the inland revenue act and the introduction of marketbased fuel pricing are major steps in terms of improving fiscal sustainability in we achieved a primary surplus in the budget for the first time in several decadesthe results of this fiscal improvement are already materialising with interest rates beginning to moderate as the yeartreasurybill yield has declined by basis points in the last monthsour exports hit an alltime high in as did fdi foreign reserves also reached comfortable levels in spite of rising global interest rates whilst inflation is within the target rangesthus it is clear that the government has successfully navigated the macroeconomy into calm stable waters in spite of precarious global conditions and onerous external debt obligationswhilst acknowledging our gains in the short term the clear priority is for the government to take measures to kick start economic growth it is in this context that we have accelerated two key programmes enterprise sri lanka and gamperaliya which can have a transformational impact on both rural and urban economiesenterprise sri lanka provides a range of targeted interest subsidies to stimulate economic activity through private investment and boosting small business gamperaliya will infuse life into the rural economy through a rapid public investment programme for rural infrastructure which will help the recovery from setbacks in two successive years of droughtdespite creating a conducive economic environment a country will never truly develop without investing in its people our greatest resource this government has prioritised spending on education and health servicesexpenditure on education higher education skills vocational training reached of gdp in and will be of gdp in expenditure on health was of gdp in and will be of gdp this yearsuch expenditure on social infrastructure may not be visible like a mega project but it has a meaningful impact on the wellbeing of peopleas a government that strongly believes in international partnerships not isolation we have pledged to achieve the united nations sustainable development goals by in order to realise the full potential of our entire populationevery citizen in this country will become a shareholder of the knowledge based highly competitive social market economy that has been envisaged in our vision policy documentit is therefore clear that this government has not taken the easy short cuts towards populist economic interventions that can provide short term benefits but leads to long term painwe have inherited the adverse effects of such myopic policies implemented in the past but chose not to tread the same patha set of well thought out measures are being implemented to provide a sustainable long term solution to the development needs of sri lankathe benefits of these reforms may not fully materialize immediately but with the combined efforts of all stakeholders we have the opportunity to collectively build a strong sustainable and equitable economy and society

september lbo founder sanjiva weerawarana is moving on from software company wso relinquishing his employment as chief software architect this is after relinquishing the ceo position in the recent past the employee firm is one of the most successful software companies in sri lankaweerawarana will continue on as nonexecutive chairman and retain a shareholding of close to of the company he recently released his farewell email to employees the full email is reproduced belowi guess this will be a bit of a surprise some people let me start by sharing the email i sent to all wso people a few days agofrom sanjiva weerawarana sanjivawso com date tue aug am days ago to teamgroup architecture ballerinagroup subject confidential time for me to move on from wso onto another chapter of my lifehi everyoneits now been more than years since wso s birth and i ve decided its time to move on from my employee status as chief architect this coming friday august will be my last day of work as a wso employeei m actually not going that far though i will remain on the board and will continue to be the chairman further i will also be continuing to provide technical leadership to ballerina but as a consultant and not as an employee in particular i will no longer be owning product architecture or strategy as i have from pretty much the birth of the companyso its not really a full good bye at all but rather a change of relationship for me but it is a big change for me to say i no longer work in wso why and why now its been nearly an year since tyler took over as the ceo the company is growing nicely and while we don t always agree on everything um serverless anyone i am extremely pleased with how tyler has taken over and transitioned the company to a new leadership architecture that s not easy given i m still around and that i um can apparently be a bit of a pita for anyone and everyone no one who managed me has ever said i was easy to manage our current business is doing really well and the changes tyler s been driving are working well to keep the growth going if we sustain a arr growth rate for more years we ll easily be worth b and we can do it while generating money we have a fantastic engineering and product innovation approach and team that can keep us ahead of our crappyass competitors and our marketing and sales can keep generating money while finance admin legal and hr keep spending it wisely so this is a done deal if we all keep doing the right thingswe ve started on a brand new product architecture with dickvick and i have confidence the architecture leaders in the company can see this through to its rightful coursein the meantime ballerina is chugging along well but there s a lot more to do i am not leaving ballerina at all i will continue to be its technical leader but just operating as a consultant to the company and with my responsibility limited to ballerina in totality but not to the wso productsto be honest stepping down from the ceo job and being around and watching someone else mess with my baby has not been easy for me personally but i couldn t be happier with tyler as the new ceo and he will have my full support from the board minus the meddling as an employee to continue to build tremendous value for wso thus i leave with the full confidence that i m leaving a company in good condition and in solid hands and that s not just tyler its all of youwhat s next for me retirement hell bloody no i ve never worked a regular hr day so i don t expect to start nowa few weeks ago at lsf s th anniversary i rebooted lanka software foundation version where we are going to focus on building software to help run the countrysidebar many of you may not know that lsf is the cause and birth of wso lsf created axismora in srinath leader and dimuthul were interns when they worked on it and then axis which is what gave the idea the opportunity and initial team to start wso all of the original team went onto grad school finished cs phds and are all over the world including in sri lanka in the form of srinath who was the original brains behind axismorai have a bunch of plans on that and we already have full time engineers working on things and i plan to get more people i will be spending a lot of my time helping with that work i m also advocating good architecture to various parts of the sri lankan government and i plan to do a lot more of that tooi ve also been meaning to start teaching again so maybe one of these days oh yeah plus blog a lot more and be even more critical of politics and politicians globally of course i don t discriminateall that is beyond my day job first will be to see ballerina to and then we ll see what next i also will be more active on the board and will likely end up being a bigger pita through that than before you until tyler took over i used to interview every single person who joined that means i ve interviewed most of you when we started many of you were people i had taught but over time that changed of course and now we have people from all over sri lanka and globally i never checked for skills i only checked whether your values fit with wanting to leave your mark on the worldin the end life is not about titles and salaries its all about what impact you have in the world if you have children then how you raise them and how they act in the world is the biggest impact you can have children or not as individuals we all can have a positive or zero or negative impact and wso was always designed to be a company that focused on delivering a positive impact for the world by giving its people the environment and the opportunity to have a positive impact on the world oh yeah and to create value for all its stakeholders along the way but really that just falls out naturally if we do it rightsidebar one of my interview questions used to be what do you want people to say when you die and if the person answered it wrong i wouldn t hire the personone thing i always believed in and still do is that anyone can do anything given the right opportunity the right environment and the right support i have been tremendously lucky in my life to have got many amazing opportunities in the right environment with the right support to be able to do what i ve done in my life so far so i ve always taken it as my duty to give others a chance whenever i can a chance to be successful by giving them the opportunity the environment and the support of course not everyone will take it and run with it but most do sometimes after a kick in the nuts to wake them upnot everyone is as lucky as many of us have been to get to where we are now its your turn to give a break to someone give that person with a weird resume a chance give that person with poor confidence a chance give that person with bad english a chance give that person with a good heart a chance give that person with no experience but with passion a chance who knows some of them might end up being people who help you build a billion dollar companyworking with you all has been a tremendous honor and a privilege for me i have learnt sooo much in these years that its beyond description when i started i knew nothing about middleware and many of you know way way more than i did back then i leave with not just technical knowledge about middleware but also how to deploy it for real in the form of a solution to a business problem i was a cs researcher who became a ceo so you all helped me build the company from to nearly people and taught me what leadership at nontrivial scale means i of course made plenty of mistakes along the way but c est la viefrom a sri lanka specific angle we were repeatedly told by experienced pundits how so many things couldn t be done from sri lanka product design product management engineering leadership sales marketing events research etc etc etc and we proved all those naysayers wrong hell we were doing content marketing before that even became a thing as a sri lankan i m tremendously proud of what we all achieved no software company in sri lanka has come even close to us and even out of india there are only like that have come this far that s pretty damned awesome and we re in elite company unfortunately that hasn t stopped the pundits yet but that s the way with the world we have to keep proving them wrong foreverof course we didn t achieve that in isolation wso is a global corporation with a global family of awesome people working together to impact the world in a good way i know its not easy to work in a company with people separated by the largest possible number of timezones especially when there s a skewed center of gravity in one location so i owe a special thank you to all those from outside of sri lanka who patiently dealt with all the complexity of being global and more impatiently lived with my often country biased opinionsin life nothing is permanent or absolutely true so remember to be always dispassionately passionate about everything and never hesitate to call bs on things above all never lie to yourself its ok to lie to others sometimes but never to yourselfthank you once again to everyone for giving me by far the best years of my life i have full confidence that wso will go on to being an awesome company because of all the amazing people that you all are never forget the goal though its not to make more arr or to do the product release or whatever its all about making it possible for all of us to impact the world in a positive way whatever gains we get will come out of working hard to do the right things not the other way aroundsteve jobs said the journey is the reward it has been indeed been an amazing journey for me and hence a tremendous rewardthank yousanjiva

company in the sense that i own it well that s not even remotely true and it never was i am the founder of it and owned of it when we started the way venture funded companies work is that your ownership percentage goes down as you sell more shares to bring in capital i explained how that works in this talk as a result i now own a small percentage of the company around in fact all employees collectively own about of wso right now and even a big part of my ownership is from option grants i received after the first years so my dwindled down way below even that s normal as the expectation hope is that your small piece is now part of a much larger pie and therefore worth more that certainly is the case for wso we started off with the company which only had an open office slide deck as its assets being valued at m and are now a real company worth at least a few hundred million dollars note that for a privately held company worth is really a theoretical concept as its real value is what someone is willing to pay for it and being privately held no one knows for sure ever since wso became years old i ve been meaning to write a series of blogs documenting the history of the company i want to do it to both record the history as i remember it and to help others who are struggling through as entrepreneurs see that i and wso have gone through lots of pain and problems tooin my email i briefly mentioned how i got a ton of lucky breaks to get to the point of starting wso and to being able to build it up i don t come from a rich or powerful or connected family and father worked in oman for many years which is what facilitated my going to the us to study in yet i was one of the lucky ones in having amazing parents who absolutely valued education and made it our number one goal after that i got many lucky breaks that took hard work to take advantage of but there are plenty of people who do the hard work but don t get the break and end up on a very different opportunity trajectorywhen i write the history of wso i plan to individually highlight people who made it possible by sometimes small and sometimes massive gambles that made it all possible in the meantime thank you to all of you who made it all possiblethere is no such thing as a selfmade man we are made up of thousands of others everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us or spoken one word of encouragement to us has entered into the makeup of our character and of our thoughts as well as our successgeorge matthew adams

dr romesh bandaranaike shares his unique perspective of sri lanka s plantationswith the fate of sri lanka s plantation industry continuing to remain as a hotbutton issue of debate in the media numerous views have been aired on the rationale behind the privatization of state plantations in in order to clarify the facts regarding privatization and the conditions which made it necessary in the first place the planters association of ceylon facilitated a discussion with one of the prominent individuals who rendered yeoman service to the nation by helping to drive reforms to the industry at a time when they were sorely required dr romesh dias bandaranaikehaving been closely involved with the initial privatization bandaranaike was able to offer unique insights into the journey towards privatization and some opinions on its legacy years later going back to the time before privatization the plantations in the late s were the biggest source of political patronage in the country politicians were using the resource to give jobs transport contracts and provide numerous other benefits to their supporters even small portions of land itself were hived off for private benefit the plantations of that era were constantly subject to political interference the management was not allowed to operate freely and were often forced to hire political appointees transfers and disciplinary actions were also frequently interrupted this meant that even when people were caught being crooked they were still retained meanwhile numerous individuals with influence were attempting to profit off these plantations and encroachments on these lands were becoming the norm dr bandaranaike explainedgiven the magnitude of unethical political capital vested in the state plantations and the inarguably worsening position of these estates as a result he explained how it became clear to all stakeholders that some kind of radical reform would have to be implemented to save the industry and economy from collapse from a numbers perspective alone with the exception of a short period in when there was a huge boom in international markets the janatha estates development board jedb and the sri lanka state plantations corporation slspc made continuous losses and had to be heavily subsidised by the government to the tune of rs billion per year which would be equivalent to rs billion today dr bandaranaike addedhe noted that a further rs billion times as much in today s rupees was owed by the jedb and slspc to the bank of ceylon and peoples bank as a result of a us million lending facility which was extended to the state plantations by the world bank while these funds were intended for the improvement of the plantations industry there were no significant improvements and the plantations did not have the ability to repay the debts and the government was eventually compelled to absorb this debtthe strategic thinker behind the privatisation exercise was the highly respected former ministry of finance civil servant faiz mohideen who later went on to become the deputy secretary to the treasury while bandaranaike became the public face of the exercise overall guidance and connection to the highest levels of government were provided by a three member steering committee chaired by the secretary to the treasurybandaranaike explained how an uphill battle was fought to bring industry stakeholders together to hold a discussion on the future of the sri lankan plantation industry and to find a way forward through the quagmire it found itself in following the assumption of management by the state while the exercise as initially presented to the stakeholders was purportedly to find ways to improve the operation of the jedb and the slscpc under state management ultimately it was the then chairman of the jedbwho first acknowledged that any measures identified as necessary to reform the plantation industry would be impossible to implement within a statemanaged framework there was simply too much bureaucracy and politically motivated interference to get anything done the only hope was to bring in private management once it was clear to the main stakeholders that efficient operation of the nationalized plantations was not a feasible option under state management developments moved at a fairly rapid pace cabinet approval was granted by the then president premadasa s regime to bring in private management into the plantations under contract while the government still retained ownership tender documents were drafted laying out clear criteria on how the selection would be done a number of sri lankan companies with the necessary financial and management strength applied and following a detailed analysis management contracts were awarded for regional plantation companies made up of most of the estates of the two state plantation corporations this all happened with a sense of urgency because the damage that was being done to plantations under state management could no longer be denied he explained everything was done according to a strict procedure because we wanted these reforms to be aboveboard so they would last in fact after she was elected president kumaratunga appointed a committee headed by the then secretary to the treasury to investigate and report on the exercise of bringing in private management the committee report gave a clean bill of health to the process after some years of private management on a profit share basis without direct investment it became clear that the private sector needed to invest its own funds into the estates to get the best out of them because the government could not afford to do so and also because this was the best way to ensure that invested funds were not wasted but put to profitable use this was the next stage which happened under the presidency of chandrika kumaratunga when the private sector purchased shares in the rpcs resulting in full privatisation in the context of the entire privatisation exercise it is vital that we all understand that while it is proper to debate methods through which plantations can be improved we must all remember that no matter how bad the situation gets there can be nothing worse than a reversion to state management he addedcommenting on the present status of the rpcs dr bandaranaike noted that producers rpc and smallholder alike were likely to benefit from a reevaluation as to the approach and model for selling tea the auction system that we have in place at present is problematic especially in today s world where we have such a large volume of transactions taking place online it seems like a relic of a bygone era we must look at ways of allowing producers to link up with buyers more directly there are instances when a single buyer will be able to purchase the entire produce of an estate if it is of a suitable quality and effectively marketed we have to streamline our processes to cater directly to these types of niche opportunities while also adding more value locally he statedhowever dr bandaranaikenoted that moving to a completely free market for tea sales without interference and sales regulations by the state is bound to be difficult to achieve because of the large number of parties including in the private sector with a vested interest in continuing the present arrangementshe further noted that another crucial factor for the industry moving forward will be with regards to succession in leadership in a manner that preserves and enhances the knowledge base of future leaders in the plantation sector ultimately it is crucial to have intelligent knowledgeable people in charge not just at the heads of the companies but also at the superintendent level more often than not a good superintendent will make even an estate that performs poorly produce significantly better results whereas a bad one put in charge of a profit making estate can bring down productivity and profitability in short order over generations planters have developed their own systems of meticulous record keeping that has helped to pass on knowledge on best practices for each estate but i believe more work can be done to codify this information and pass it down ultimately it is not just about good agricultural knowledge good management also requires good relationships with employees and the ability to motivate them to perform dr bandaranaike suggestedin the context of growing challenges facing the industry as a result of fluctuating international market prices and sharp variations in productivity as a result of adverse climatic conditions he also advocated for the creation of reserve funds withineach rpc to be set aside to handle future bad years which are guaranteed to arise from time to timeshifting his attention to the ongoing losses of the stateowned plantation sector these were the estates which for a number of reasons were not included in the original exercise of bringing in private management dr bandaranaike called for the further privatization to be carried out of these estates in smaller blocks than the present rpcs the government is presently subsidising losses by these estates exceeding rs billion per year provident fund and retiring gratuity payments are also very much in arrears in this sector in my view these lands after excluding areas which fall within conservation areas should be sold outright to anyone who can come up with a sustainable profitable business model after making suitable arrangements to address the relatively small amounts of labour on these lands while some lands would inevitably just be acquiredby speculators they will ultimately end in the hands of those who wish to put it to productive usethere would definitely be some innovation and even if it is to set up a boutique hotel that is still a more productive use than what is taking place under state management with most of these lands he said with agricultural innovation such as successful growing of a new crop if one person makes a success of it others will follow this is the sri lankan model of entrepreneurship one of the main obstacles to this type of privatization is the land reform act which restricts ownership of agricultural land to acres per person or company in my view there was an original rationale for the act because land ownership before its implementation was highly skewed mostly due to historic reasons either because some ancestor got large tracts from past kings or handouts given by the british to favoured parties there has now been a redistribution of these lands and there is no longer any reason to restrict ownership particularly when viable commercial agriculture needs tracts of land much larger than acres however i do believe that this legislation will eventually be replaced

emerging economies particularly in relation to analytics and research capabilities this is why saks analytics is now working to establish global partnerships that will serve to introduce such disruptive technologies to the domestic markettoday s agreement with antworks represents a bold and vital step forward in this vision that promises to usher in the same kind of hardnosed datadriven

automation industry its proprietary platform antstein is the first and only intelligent integrated endtoend automation platform available in the market today it is the only data ingestion technology that does not use ocr and is built on the principles of fractal science in comparison with other current players in the rpa domain antworks has integrated cognitive machine reading for multiformat data ingestion rpa for data transport and machine learning coupled with natural language modelling for advanced data insights all under its single sign on the antsteintm platform companies today are

documentation automation and analytics that we believe could spark a wave of innovation across the public and private sectors with the ultimate beneficiary being the sri lankan people jeevan gnanam statedthe relationship between antworks and saks analytics has been a longstanding one with preliminary discussions on their partnership having commenced in a startup that is headquartered out of

aug lbo industry professionals big data enthusiasts academics and students congregated at the latest edition of the colombo big data meetup held recently at the virtusa auditoriumpowered by virtusa the interactive sessions apprised participants of the latest developments in big data tools and technologies selvendra selvarajah associate architect at virtusa and sajeetharan sinnathurai microsoft mvp and senior tech lead at x technology delivered the key note addresses of the eveningthe session kicked off with a presentation by selvendra selvarajah on the increasing use of r programming language in industrya leading open source programming language consisting of powerful functions to tackle all problems related to big data processing it has been used only in academics historicallyhowever recent developments have seen it being more commonly used in industry selvendra believes this latest trend will make big data analytics easier for most programmers as it eliminates the requirement for fresh graduates to learn a new programming language or use another program additionally the open source nature of the language allows it to be continuously developed with improvements being freely available soon after microsoft has begun including r language in their development process making it more popular than ever this makes the lives of programmers that much easier as they can directly apply what they learn in university to real world situationsthe readytouse statistical modelling algorithms and machine learning nature of r language help speed up the process as well this makes r language invaluable for analytics driven companies and essential for those looking to create value from stored data he saidsajeetharan sinnathurai came in next and delved into the practical applications of sentiment analysishe took the audience through the different steps involved in building a sentiment analysis solution using the azure platforma live demo was run to extract data from twitter and with the participation of the audience sentiment analysis was applied on the resulting data sajeetharan believes that in an age where social media can have a profound impact on a business sentiment analysis can help businesses better understand their customers it can guide market strategy assist crisis management influence product development help monitor brand reputation and be utilized for competitive benchmarking as well as inform a host of other business outcomes the key to business has always been knowing what your customer wants and at a time where customers are constantly updating their social media with their thoughts and emotions that information has never been more accessible however unlocking the hidden value of that raw data can be tedious and overwhelming if we were to do it manually by reviewing every post ourselves this is where solutions provided by platforms like azure come into play with the implementation of azure logic apps text analytics api azure sql db and powerbi we can harness powerful insights from a single country or across the globe quickly and easily he saidthe big data meetup has been taking place each quarter since with the participation of many industry professionals and academics the event has proven popular amongst its target audience with the community growing to almost stronghaving recognized this as a great platform to bring enthusiasts students academia and the industry together and engage and update them on the latest in the world of big data virtusa has been an active part of this forum right from its inceptiontharindu buddhika senior software engineer commercial bank of ceylon plc has been an active member of this community and a key organizer of the event since its inception he believes that the popularity of these sessions can be traced to the fact that it bridges the gap between academics and industryit fills in that additional bit of knowledge that fresh graduates need when joining the it industry while giving veterans in it the opportunity to keep abreast of the latest trends when we started these sessions about four years ago big data was only an emerging field but we knew right then that it would play a big part in it simply because at that time in history there was more data being created and collected than ever before this meant that big data analysis would have a wide array of applications across several industries and if sri lanka wanted to be a part of this emerging trend then we needed to get our it professionals and undergraduates thinking and learning about big data hence we began these meetups as a way of spreading the message but it soon grew into something more a community that allowed us to share our thoughts and insights on the subject noted tharinduhe also believes that these sessions play an integral part in making big data popular within the local it industryfor more information on the colombo big data meetup and to stay informed about

aug lbo sri lanka s leading management consulting firm stax recently launched a research report outlining a dualhub it strategy for jaffnain collaboration with market development facility mdf stax released this report with a view to fostering the region s substantial potential for itrelated services in line with the national drive to develop a globallycompetitive it industry in sri lankaearlier this year the government unveiled its plans for island of ingenuity ioi a lkr m investment in the ictbpm sector by sri lanka s itbpm sector is expected to reach b in revenue create direct jobs and encompass startups stax s report highlights that jaffna is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the sector s growing momentum ultimately expanding its own contribution to the sector and the wider national economy among the noteworthy attributes we observe a positive and entrepreneurial attitude among the jaffna communities who also retain a strong connection to the sri lankan diaspora which could lead to opportunities for investment and knowledge transfer the region also maintains a high literacy rate while already possessing the necessary ict infrastructure and a range of opportunities for it education the report notedspecifically the report called for the dualhub strategy to be centered on the development of an outsourced it hub together with the establishment of a startup hub both of which could be concurrently fostered while delivering returns along different timelinesthe outsourced hub would involve relatively lowrisk activities capable of garnering quick returns in employment productivity revenue and it skilling initially the report envisioned its implementation within the format of a person managed services operation that matches local talent to outsourced demand with a gradual focus on upscaling to accommodate new market opportunities when considering the implementation of this hub there are at least three potential avenues through which a managed services operation in jaffna can carve a niche for itself in itbpo outsourcing both globally and islandwide quality assurance tamil call centers and kpo for accounting services the report addedcomparatively stax envisions the jaffna startup hub as providing greater longterm returns for the region and the national economy initially focusing on the development of complex and strategic areas of expertise in specific innovations and creating a strong network of ip skills that would shift the focus from importing foreign technology to encouraging and embracing homegrown innovationthe report advocated a combination of traditional and creative startup strategies while the traditional startups could focus on specialized web and appbased development and search engine optimization the creative startups could be oriented around prevailing primary industries in the north including agriculture farming fisheries tourism and health in addition to catering to industries of necessity through products like smart street lighting waste management health travel and education related apps the viability of this strategy is already borne out in the organic maneuvers of prominent sri lankan it startup accelerators like yarl it hub and ncit and it companies like ws microimage and infomate the current challenge however is that many such forwardthinking players operate in isolation or do not benefit from adequate access to resourcesthrough the formal inclusion of these organic activities in a dedicated strategy for jaffna the goal is to build momentum and focus in terms of investment and activity being channeled into this space whether via global or local investors the report statedthe recommendations of the report are informed by a detailed assessment of the overall it industry in jaffna and the broader north including over conversations across industry experts national it enablers it accelerators private sector companies local government diaspora members jaffnabased employees and universities and schoolsfor interested investors and stakeholders there is a clear call to action the first order of business is to conduct an evaluation of the financial and technical feasibility of developing a managed services operation for the outsourced hub subsequently there is a need to secure smart capital for this effort which will include crafting a compelling story when pitching to relevant investorsas stax s managing director ruwindhu peiris argued global success stories like malaysia s cyberjaya make it clear that digital hubsare the product of a catalytic movement where investors and digitalcompanies grow to a critical mass for this to happen all keystakeholders need to come together in a cohesive move otherwise there s only dispersion in essence local iteducation providers need to develop industryready graduatescolombobased it companies need to move past perceptions andseriously investigate the viability of setting up in the north membersof the diaspora need to be engaged to create targeted flows offunding and technology transfer northern startup accelerators needto cultivate the funds and partnerships necessary to foster newentrants the government needs to collaborate with externalfunding agencies privatesector players nonprofit organizationsand other investors to further develop the infrastructure andincentives for a digital hubabove all the movement needs to be communicated to the masses in that sense this report comes at a critical juncture as mano sekaram ceo and cofounder of x technology pointed out for a long time the biggest drawback we ve faced as investors and stakeholders is the absence of a bankable document to promote jaffna as an it hub this report is a step in the right direction and an important

specialize in the settlement of securities transactions and the safekeeping of securities on behalf of domestic and international investorstoday cds handles demat operations accounts services corporate action services and clearing settlement services to its stakeholders all possible as a result of a transformational journey of constant innovation stakeholder focus and technical advancement currently the cds has dematerialized over of listed securities a benchmark for depositaries in the south asian regiona number of depositaries around the world are expanding on their traditional role to be more customer facing by offering new services and leveraging on technology as for cds in sri lanka we are staying true to our vision to look beyond our core function and we are constantly looking at means through which we could offer better value to stakeholders of the sri lankan capital market we are well in the process of aligning with our stakeholders even further with our new service offerings and are focused on developing into a more customer centric customer experience driven organization it is a transformational period for cdswhat has cds done in recent times to move beyond this traditional scope we have expanded our service offering to include corporate action services and registrar services for companies listed on the cse and also privately held unlisted companies which is essentially a forward integration into our value chainthe introduction of this new service by cds has i must say been well received by listed companies at large where since launching cds has onboarded eight companies for registrar services our registrar services offer coverage for corporate actions such as dividends rights issues capitalizations of reserves mandatory offers voluntary offers sub divisions of shares and capital reductions in addition new service introductions also include cds maintaining the company s share ledger attending to regulatory and statutory requirements and delivering other forms of administrative support functions for listed entities cds has established a new unit to handle these areas of services which is different from the operations of the depositorythe fact that cds has been at the heart of the sri lankan stock market offers us vital differentiation and uniquely positions cds to effectively deliver these services considering that these services are linked to our core services we also have the ability to offer cost efficiencies and considerable convenience to listed companies and their investorshow will the investor community benefit from these new introductions edividend payments for an instance have the potential to offer tremendous value and convenience to investors companies make dividend payments via cheques at present which often could result in delays and a longer process through which investors would receive their paymentscompanies registering with cds for registrar services now have the ability to electronically transfer dividends directly to an investor s bank account which is a seamless process where investors would receive their dividend payment on the date of payment without delays this service as of now is only available to companies subscribing to cds registrar services but with this introduction we anticipate that the service will be wellreceived by all investors which will result in other registrar service providers in the market also facilitating edividend payments benefitting the investment community atlarge like i said before the wider objective here is to introduce initiatives that would help raise the bar in service levels across the value chain in the sri lankan capital market and not only cdsthrough edividend payments listed companies on the other hand are provided with an opportunity to better serve their investors through innovation our focus is on providing tailormade customized solutions to corporates where we understand their specific requirements with relation to registrar services and service them in a timely and efficient mannerthe introduction of these new services places cds in par with regional and international depositories with evidence of many success stories of depositaries effectively diversifying into related business areas to offer value to stakeholders we have every reason to believe that cds will be successful in doing the same here in sri lanka as wellwhat does the near future hold in terms of other technology driven introductionswe intend to introduce an endtoend digital cds account opening process in the near future which will go a long way in making the market accessible around the country and also in broadbasing our local investor base which is pivotal to the progress of the sri lankan stock market in the longrunwith the introduction of this new service cds will have the ability to capture and verify information on prospective investors digitally through a mobile application in realtime in a convenient and secure manner this will facilitate a faster and smoother account opening process for prospective investors offering them the option of not engaging in what would be perceived as a lengthy paperwork driven physical application processthe first step of this endeavor is to fully digitize the documentation process and we are presently working with stockbroker firms to this end as the next step stockbroker firms will be given the authority to directly create cds accounts on behalf of clients which will provide investors the opportunity to trade almost immediately as opposed to the present system where the account opening formalities would take a few days as both the cds and the stockbroker firm would have to coordinatethis new service will complement other forms of recently introduced technology driven solutions in the cds account handling process including estatements and the web portal for online cds account management cds econnectimplementing a fullyfledged eipo system to facilitate a more efficient and convenience driven ipo process and evoting for shareholders is also being planned and worked on at present and we expect a roll out in the near futurethe ease of doing business is a key parameter for prospective investors when selecting a service provider in the investment services space which cds operates in and it is important that cds positions itself in this manner going forward because the rest of the financial services industry is strongly driven through secure and convenient solutionsfeature interview by cse

fitch ratings has affirmed sri lankabased retailer abans plc s abans national longterm rating at bbblka with a stable outlook a full list of rating action is at the end of this commentarythe affirmation reflects fitch s view that abans will continue to make meaningful progress towards improving its net leverage defined as leaseadjusted debt net of cashoperating ebitdar to around x by the end of the financial year to march fy we expect this to be supported by a recovery in profitability because the company will be better able to pass through costs to customers as well as operating efficiencies and moderating capex and investments abans net leverage improved significantly to x in the months to endjune from x at fye and x at fye however we may take negative rating action in the next six to months if abans deviates from its deleveraging trendabans rating also reflects its strong market position in consumer durables retail in sri lanka its extensive brand portfolio supported by a wide distribution network and a wellmanaged hirepurchase hp business which are partly offset by its investment in a large real estate project however the risks stemming from the noncore investment has substantially reduced over the past months because the project is near completion which has reduced pressure on abans for additional fundingkey rating driversleverage to improve we expect the pace of abans deleveraging to pick up in fy as profitability recovers dividend inflows from its associate company increase and efficient use of working capital we expect abans to be able to reduce leverage to around x by fye when it starts realising the full benefits of the cost efficiency measures that are being put in place abans has also decided to limit capex to maintenance levels in the medium term and refrain from shareholder returns in the next couple of years which should help keep leverage at levels commensurate with the ratingmargin to widen modestly we expect abans ebitdar margin to expand around bp in the next months from the trough in fy which will be helped by a better cost passthrough and operating efficienciesmanagement plans to reduce the store network in the next months which it expects to result in a net annual cost saving of around lkr million we estimate this will widen margin by bp based on our fy revenue projections abans cut selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales by almost bp in fy and will target further cuts by eliminating redundancies and integrating processes over the medium termthe company s ebitdar margin expanded bp yoy in q however these improvements will be partly offset by continued pressure from currency depreciation on of abans cost of goods sold which the company may not be able to fully pass on to customers consequently we do not expect abans margins to recover to the highsingle digit range of the past but expect it at around in the medium term which is essential to maintain net leverage at a level commensurate with the ratingdemand to remain sluggish fitch expects abans revenue growth to slow in the next months as the recent increase in fuel prices by more than will reduce the discretionary income of consumers which will reduce demand for consumer durables we believe the fuel price rise will more than offset the recovery in demand in januaryjune stemming from better earnings in the agriculture sector low personal taxes and stable interest rates revenue growth will also be muted by the company s price increases in the past couple of months and changes to the hp sales mix to improve cost passthrough abans consumer durables retail revenue fell yoy in q turnaround in abans engineering we expect abans engineering which is involved in the installation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation and air conditioning systems to recover in fy after the new management revised its pricing strategy to guarantee a minimum margin from projects and transferred currency risk to the customer which was previously borne by the company abans engineering is the market leader and has strong growth potential due to the new buildings coming up the company had an order book of lkr billion at fye x of fy revenues providing strong revenue visibility we expect the business to contribute around to abans ebit once it reaches a steady state compared with operating losses of lkr million in fy no further cash for property the colombo city center ccc project which is a joint venture with a singaporean partner will not upstream any dividend to abans until the project loan is fully paid down in however the business risk from the project has subsided because the project is due to be completed by mid proceeds from presales have been better than expected and of its retail space has been preleased management expects ccc to open by endaugust which should help with sales of the remaining inventory around of the apartments were sold by endjuly abans is not likely to need to provide further cash if the project encounters any temporary cash flow deficits because the company s shareholders will seek funding from other sources therefore we do not expect abans to inject the remaining lkr million of its initial capital commitmentderivation summaryabans is the number two player in terms of revenue in consumer durables retail in sri lanka with a strong portfolio of wellknown brands and an extensive distribution network abans is rated one notch below its closest peer singer sri lanka plc alkastable the market leader to reflect its weaker financial profile and thinner ebitdar marginsabans is rated at the same level as dsi samson group private limited bbblkastable because abans weaker financial risk profile offsets its stronger business risk profile compared with dsi dsi is the market leader in locally manufactured footwear but faces a number of structural challenges including increasing competition from cheap imports and reducing pricing power at the same time dsi s local tyre business is under pressure due to the lower sales of twowheelers and threewheelers following an increase in taxeskey assumptionsfitch s key assumptions within

aug lbo ceylon motor traders association cmta on friday said they understand the government s policy decision taken recently to increase excise duties targeting the small motor cars segmentthe association said the excise duty structure that was proposed in the budget had a favorable differential for small motor cars which is likely to have driven the strong vehicle growth experienced in cmta said this situation has added a further strain on the nation s current account which is already seeing an expanding fuel import bill given the rising global oil prices in according to the department of motor traffic approx percent of all motor vehicle registrations for that year was accounted for by vehicles under cc cmta said subsequent to the tariff revisions proposed in the budget small cars accounted for approx percent of all motor vehicle registrations during the first two months of in addition this growth in the quantum of vehicles is likely to have resulted in a significant rise in the levels of congestion specially within the cities the association said the raising of excise duties is likely to stem the growth for small cars but they believe that this needs to be coupled with medium to longterm policies that would result in the sustainable growth of the motor industry this would also reduce the need to resort to such ad hoc excise duty changes which leads to the stopgo nature of new vehicle imports that leads to uncertainty and causes a strain on both the consumers and firms in the industry the cmta looks forward to participating in a longterm policy dialogue with the government so the aspirations of the industry and the international manufacturers they represent could be aligned with the requirements of the government

by ganeshan wignaraja and amitendu palitjuly lbo while the global trade war threatens to disrupt the momentum of global trade and the prospects of global economic growth encouraging signs of commitment to trade are visible elsewhere countries across the world continue to remain committed to free trade notwithstanding anxieties over the course of the trade war and its greater impact on global commerce the eu and japan have just signed a bilateral free trade agreement fta paving the way for unrestricted trade within their combined economies of more than us trillion the growth of a preferential trading bloc between europe and asia as represented by the eujapan fta would produce considerable energy for trade prospects in the asiapacific the prospects also stand to augment from another bilateral fta that came into effect in may the sri lanka singapore fta slsfta structure and characterwhile economic size of the singaporesri lanka fta is not comparable to that of the eu japan fta or any of the asean ftas it is notable for various reasons it is sri lanka s first fta since and the most comprehensive among the handful it has signed so far the fta not only include traditional trade issues like trade in goods trade remedies trade facilitation and dispute settlement but also covers trade in services investments intellectual property rights government procurement competition and ecommerce in this respect the fta represents a modern st century fta that includes not just traditional trade issues but also those identified as wto plus or extra issues subjects like competition investment intellectual property and procurement that have been found difficult to be taken forward at the wto and are discussed by some ambitious ftas including the comprehensive and progressive transpacific partnership cptpp like all ftas expansion of market access by eliminating tariffs is an important feature of the slsfta singapore being one of the world s most open economies with bulk of imports being allowed entry dutyfree save a few the onus of liberalisation was on sri lanka sri lanka will be progressively eliminating tariffs on per cent of goods over years under the agreement which is a relatively long adjustment period however the long phasing is understandable given the concerns that domestic industries might have had on opening up and the economic uncertainties that higher supply of imports might create in some segments of the economy beyond tariffs the slsfta has paid heed to the issue of nontariff measures particularly through separate and detailed mention of quality standards for food products in both countries that mutual imports need to adhere to these illustrations can act as benchmarks for future ftas in so far as transparent outlining of quality standards are concerned that would prevent exporters from encountering unexpected regulatory barriers the agreement has also laid down detailed provisions on commitment in services trade including separate chapters on telecommunications and ecommerce these provisions should help in facilitation of digital trade between both economies in the coming years and the development of sri lanka s ambitious port city financial center regional connectionsafter india the slsfta is singapore s second comprehensive fta with a south asian economy the agreement underlines singapore s search for trade and investment partners beyond east and southeast asia and it s recognition of sri lanka s potential as a trading hub in the fastgrowing indian ocean region on the other hand from a sri lankan perspective the agreement is an outcome of the country s postconflict trade policy to boost flagging growth and strengthen ties with southeast asia and the asiapacificas sri lanka gets closely embedded in the southeast asian trade and business network through slsfta it gets closer to the possibility of becoming a formal part of the asean trade architecture indeed the agreement marks the beginning of the possibility of sri lanka joining the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep upon the conclusion of rcep at a future date and become a core element of asia s big fta game sri lanka s aspirations are expected to be endorsed by singapore joining rcep which would be the world s largest fta between the tenmember asean and it s six fta partners accounting for more than a third of global gdp and almost half of the global population would provide sri lanka access to an enormous regional market and dynamic asian fdi participating in rcep is also arguably simpler for and less draining on sri lanka s scarce negotiating capacity than separately negotiating multiple bilateral ftas rcep membership will bind sri lanka more exhaustively with the asean architecture with which now its linkages are through its membership of the asean regional forum which mainly discusses security issues towards a fruitful slsftamuch of the possibilities of sri lanka s greater integration with the asean architecture and acceding to rcep would depend upon the success of slsfta there are several examples of ftas signed with considerable enthusiasm not being able to live up to expectations it is important to ensure particularly for sri lanka the slsfta maximizes its potential benefits this would however require addressing a few challengesone of the main sources of benefit for sri lanka from slsfta is an increase in fdi from singapore just about of inward fdi into sri lanka during came from singapore the slsfta would enable improvement of investment climate for foreign firms through its provisions on safeguards against expropriation of and discrimination against foreign investments singaporean firms can bid for large government procurement projects in sri lanka sri lanka s board of investment is also targeting singaporean fdi in infrastructure it services tourism and education nonetheless sri lanka s overall investment climate needs to improve in on ground doing business parameters such as opening a business streamlining redundant colonialera business regulations and demonstrating consistency in economic policy would help gain the confidence of riskaverse singaporean investors greater intercountry agency cooperation such as between singapore s economic development board edb and sri lanka s board of investment can help sri lanka in locating sustainable fdi in key sectors like transport logistics and urban development the board of investment needs to step away from managing exportprocessing zones and refocus its capacity on investment promotion opening its first overseas office in singapore could contribute significantly to this objective the slsfta must note the concerns of sri lankan business over roundtripping of statesubsidised imports from asean and china via singapore such concerns can be addressed through effective usage of slsfta s rules of origin which require at least per cent of value added to occur in singapore furthermore additional concerns over surge in imports arising from lowering of tariffs can be addressed by strengthening temporary trade remedies like wtocompatible safeguards and antidumping policies finally worries exist over the free movement of skilled professionals eg doctors engineers and lawyers to sri lanka from third countries however the slsfta only provides for controlled entry of a few foreign managers and technical manpower per project which usually accompany fdi internationally looking aheadsri lanka and singapore s warm diplomatic relations have not been accompanied by equal robustness in their trade and business relations the slsfta is expected to change this substantially both sides are expected to benefit significantly from the agreement sri lanka is expected to gain through import of cheaper consumer goods and intermediate inputs fdi and technology transfer and healthy competition for domestic producers singapore businesses on the other hand will gain from greater access and investment opportunities in sri lanka s growing economy its base of literate and productive workers and sri lanka s strategic location for plugging deeper in indian ocean trade and the south asian regional market from a larger regional perspective slsfta symbolises greater institutional bonding between south asia and southeast asia as well between global trade traffic encompassing the maritime spaces of malacca strait bay of bengal and the indian ocean in this vein singapore is working with india and japan to develop the trincomalee port the world s fifth largest natural harbour and trincomalee city in northeastern sri lanka such integration of maritime trade and business is great news at a time when global trade prospects are threatened by uncertainties it is important for both singapore and sri lanka to capitalize the most from slsfta for establishing benefits of ftas and upholding the virtues of free tradedr amitendu palit is senior research fellow and research lead trade and economic

 maintains negative outlook july lbo moody s investors service has today affirmed the government of sri lanka s foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings at b and maintained the negative outlookmoody s investors service said the decision to affirm the rating at b reflects sri lanka s progress in implementing the planned reform program which entails fiscal consolidation and a buildup foreign exchange reserves buffers ahead of the end of the imf extended fund facility program in june along with the moderate per capita income levels and stronger institutions relative to many similarlyrated sovereigns this is balanced against moody s expectation that the sovereign s fiscal strength will remain very low and government liquidity and external vulnerability risk will remain rating constraints moody s investors service said the decision to maintain the negative outlook reflects sri lanka s ongoing high vulnerability to a potential tightening in external and domestic financing conditions given relatively large borrowing needs reliance on external funding and still low reserves adequacy that feature dominates sri lanka s credit profile moody s investors service said in a statementaccording to moody s the government could face significantly tighter refinancing conditions at some point during the next few years which would quickly lead to much weaker debt affordability and a higher debt burden especially if the currency depreciated at the same timeconcurrently the localcurrency bond and deposit ceilings remain unchanged at ba the foreigncurrency bond ceiling is unchanged at ba and the foreign currency deposit ceiling at b ratings rationalerationale for the rating affirmation at b relatively strong institutions and ongoing reforms bolster refinancing capacityunder its imf extended fund facility program sri lanka continues to advance reforms that support fiscal consolidation and attempt to reduce external vulnerabilities progress in fiscal consolidation and in building up of reserves buffers strengthens the credit profile by providing greater assurance of sri lanka s ability to refinance its domestic and external debt at affordable coststhe government s commitment to continuing to broaden and deepen its revenue base including through implementation of the inland revenue act ira which came into effect in april will bolster revenue generation moreover legislative measures pursuant to changes in the fiscal management responsibility act aim to apply fiscal rules that ensure deficit and debt consolidation efforts endure beyond the conclusion of the imf programin addition the planned changes to the monetary law act should strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of sri lanka s monetary policy helping the central bank anchor inflation expectations and prevent fiscal dominance if effective this would contribute to stabilising the cost of debt at lower levels and as a result enhance fiscal flexibilitythe active liability management act alma will provide the government with some flexibility to smooth the timing of its debt refinancing operations within a given year over time effective use of the alma may allow the sri lankan government to smooth somewhat the consecutive large debt maturities over the period and to prevent the recurrence of such a concentration in future during the next few years however the gains will be limited given the high frequency of debt repaymentsin addition the government plans to further diversify external funding sources through the issuance of chinese renminbi or japanese yen denominated bonds as well as loans from other bilateral or multilateral lenderspersistently high government debt burden low debt affordability and still lowreserves adequacy remain key credit weaknessesbalancing sri lanka s credit strengths is very low fiscal strength which will remain a key source of risk over the next few years despite prospects for further narrowing of the budget deficit and gradual decline in government debt as a share of gdp the country s reliance on external financing without commensurate foreign exchange inflows also means that sri lanka s external position remains fragile despite a buildup in foreign exchange reserves recentlyas a baseline moody s assumes broadly stable overall financing conditions for the government under this assumption together with continued fiscal consolidation after the end of the imf program albeit at a slower pace moody s expects the government s debt burden to continue to decline over the remainder of the decadehowever even in the absence of shocks debt will only fall slowly to around of gdp by the turn of the decade from of gdp in moody s estimates that government gross borrowing requirements incorporating projections on fiscal deficits and maturing government debt repayments to reach about of gdp in and in the baseline forecasts them to fall to a stillhigh level of by a significant proportion of the government s debt is financed at short maturities including treasury bills equivalent to around of outstanding domestic debt or about of gdp in given a relatively narrow domestic financing market the government remains reliant on external bilateral and commercial lenders continued willingness to refinance large amounts of foreign currency debt moody s estimates that the government will have made principal payments on external debt of around billion per year on average from despite moody s expectation of a further rise in the level and an improvement in the quality of foreign exchange reserves persistently low reserves adequacy denotes vulnerability to a shift in foreign financing conditions moody s estimates that sri lanka s external vulnerability indicator evi the ratio of external debt payments due over the next year to foreign exchange reserves will continue to hover around in the next few years well above the median level of brated sovereignsthe government s strategy is to shift some of its funding to domestic local currency investors given lower debt repayments on domestic treasury bonds in coming years moody s expects treasury bond maturities to fall to around of gdp on average per year over the period from from about of gdp in providing some space for the government to increase localcurrency borrowings to finance the fiscal deficitbut while this will help reduce exchange rate risk given local currency interest rates are much higher than the average cost of external debt debt affordability will remain weak interest payments will continue to absorb of revenue in the next couple of years and will remain highly sensitive to either a rise in the cost of debt andor a slower revenue increase than currently assumedrationale for maintaining the negative outlookthe negative outlook reflects moody s view that sri lanka s credit profile is dominated by the government s and country s elevated exposure to refinancing risk sri lanka could face significantly tighter external refinancing conditions at some point during the next five years which would quickly lead to much weaker debt affordability especially if the currency were to depreciate as a resultwith a persistently high debt burden weak debt affordability large borrowing needs and low foreign reserve adequacy sri lanka s vulnerability to a shift in domestic and external financing conditions is highin particular every year between and the government will need to make principal payments on external debt of around billion per year about billion overall in addition to financing part of the budget deficit externally for the economy as a whole part of the current account deficit corresponds to private sector activities also financed externally moody s expects the overall current account deficit to be around of gdp in the next few years or around billion on average per yearin general the government s ongoing progress on fiscal consolidation relies on further effective implementation of revenue reforms which has only started the need to maintain sizeable primary surpluses over time and beyond the imf program will test the government s resolve especially if gdp growth remains relatively mutedmoreover despite very substantial export potential sri lanka has not yet managed to broaden its export base on a sustained basisfurther against the backdrop of a fractious political environment persistent disruptive politics may lead to delays in legislative approval of future reforms and could potentially slow or sidetrack effective implementation of newly passed reforms as a result perceptions that the country s twin deficits could widen again could reduce investors appetite for investment in sri lankan debtwhat could change the rating upthe negative outlook signals that an upgrade is unlikelymoody s would consider returning the outlook to stable should it conclude that external and domestic refinancing risks were likely to diminishthat conclusion could be prompted by a faster and more sustained buildup of nondebt creating foreign exchange inflows than currently expected which together with the demonstrated effectiveness of liability management strategies to smoothen and lengthen maturity payments would significantly lower external vulnerability risksover time the implementation of further significant fiscal reforms that markedly raised government revenue and improved debt affordability and thus fiscal strength could also prompt moody s to stabilise the outlookwhat could change the rating downmoody s would consider downgrading the rating if it were to conclude that external and domestic refinancing capacity will not improve and that sri lanka was likely to face difficulties in refinancing its domestic or external debt at affordable costs evidence that implementation of key policies is not effective including further fiscal consolidation monetary policy independence from fiscal developments diversification of financing sources or liability management would likely have a negative impact on sri lanka s access to and cost of financein particular a marked weakening in reserve adequacy from already low levels which could stem from a loss of investor confidence and thereby capital outflows would put downward pressure on the rating a halt or reversal in fiscal consolidation that raised prospects of a higher government debt burden and prevented the expected decline in gross borrowing requirements could also prompt a downgradeeconomic data and rating

 revises outlook to stable july lbo fitch ratings has affirmed sri lankabased lion brewery ceylon plc s national longterm rating at alka and the outlook has been revised to stable from negativefitch has also affirmed the national longterm rating on lion s outstanding senior unsecured debentures at alka full statement is reproduced belowfitch ratings has affirmed sri lankabased lion brewery ceylon plc s national longterm rating at alka the outlook is revised to stable from negative fitch has also affirmed the national longterm rating on lion s outstanding senior unsecured debentures at alka the outlook was revised to stable because we expect lion to be able to maintain leverage defined as leaseadjusted debt net of cash operating ebitdar at less than x over the medium term lion was able to improve its net leverage to x as of march fye from x at fye helped by the recovery in sales volume and operating profitability the recovery was underpinned by a revision in excise taxes which was announced in the sri lankan government s budget on november the revised regime taxes alcoholic beverages with lower alcohol content at reduced rates compared to spiritsfitch rates lion on its standalone strength due to weak linkages between lion and its ultimate parent carson cumberbatch plc in line with fitch s parent and subsidiary rating linkage criteria lion s alka rating reflects its leading market position in the domestic beer industry which is protected by stringent regulation a wellestablished brand and extensive retail coverage however the domestic excise tax regime on alcoholic beverage sales changes frequently which inhibits the industry s profitabilitykey rating driversrecovery in sales volume fitch expects lion s sales volume to improve in the medium term after excise duties were revised to tax manufacturers of hard liquor at higher rates than beer and wine makers the sri lankan government reduced excise taxes on strong beer by mild beer by while raising that on hard liquor by effective from november previously excise duty per unit of alcohol of strong beer was higher than that of hard liquor which depressed lion s sales volumes from november to october when the previous tax regime was in effectbalance sheet to strengthen we believe that lion s net leverage will remain below x the level at which fitch would consider negative rating action in the medium term this is mainly due to improving profitability and likely reduction in capex as the company has adequate brewing capacity to meet growing demand over the medium term fitch expects lion s leverage to continue to improve from the fye level giving it more headroom for its alka ratingimproving ebitdar margin fitch expects lion s ebitdar margins to improve by around bp in fy from in fy and to stabilise at around from fy supported by better sales volume and operating conditions lion s ebitdar margin recovered significantly in fy from a low of in fy when manufacturing was halted temporarily due to floods and lion had to import inventory at a higher cost the margin recovery was driven by the company s efforts to recoup some of the lost sales volumes and operational efficiencies that reduced costslion s sales volumes and profitability were also helped by the change in the excise tax regime in november however margins may be somewhat constrained in the near term because of the depreciating sri lanka rupee which raises the cost of the onethird of lion s key production inputs that are likely to be importedmarket leadership position lion is the largest beer manufacturer in sri lanka with significant market share in the domestic strong beer market during fy lion consolidated its market leadership by regaining the shelf space it lost in fy due to the temporary halt in production following floods in may lion s strong market share is supported by its entrenched brand and widespread retail coverage with access to retail outlets around sri lanka the company s market position is protected to some extent by regulations in the form of stringent restrictions on advertising and limited issuance of new retail licenseshigh regulatory risk domestic alcoholic beverage producers face frequent revisions to excise duties which cause significant operating cash flow volatility in the government increased the excise duties on alcohol twice which led to tax on strong beer overtaking the tax on hard liquor on an equivalentalcohol basis this situation was reversed after months which resulted in hard liquor taxed at more than both strong and mild beer on an equivalentalcohol basis we believe any further tax increases will be gradual considering the importance of the industry to government coffers excise duties from alcoholic beverage makers made up of government tax revenue in derivation summarylion s rating is supported by its leading market position in the domestic beer industry but counterbalanced by high regulatory risks in the form of frequent tax policy revisions that have previously caused operating cash flow volatility lion s business risk profile is weaker compared with its closest rating peer hemas holdings plc aalkastable hemas is a welldiversified conglomerate with exposure to the defensive healthcare and the manufacturing of personal care and homecare products hemas also has a conservative approach to acquisitions

by nandika buddhipalaintroductionthe origination of financial reporting can be closely connected to the requirement to collect and record data which evolved into a stage where the capacity of the human brain was not sufficient to accommodate and memorize the evolving volume of data and transactions interestingly the existence of record keeping can be traced back to even five thousand years before the invention of double entry book keeping in th century by italian mathematician fra luca bartolomeo de pacioli where such evidence can be unraveled during to bc among sumerians lived in southern mesopotamia astonishingly the first recorded name in the human history supposed to be an accountant in the name of kushim rather than a poet prophet or a warriorthe long history of financial reporting in the form of accounting and book keeping signifies the evolution of socioeconomic back drop and certain prerequisites for the emergence of financial reporting such as formation of private property and property rights employment of wealth in the form of capital creation of credit emergence of money as the common denominator for exchange and the development of commerce up to the level of interchanging of goods on a widespread level etchistorical perspectivethe traditional accounting history perspective emphasizes the fact that accounting and financial reporting is required for rational decision making purposes and such information requirements for rational decision making demands the development and evolution of accounting and financial reporting under demand response theory however it is worthwhile to mention the fact that the alternative view is that the accounting information is produced not only in response to the rational demand but also for social and political reasons it is also understood that the accounting and financial reporting has been a progressive and relative process rather than a static one where the subject matter has been constantly changing and evolvingtheoretical frameworkfinancial reporting and disclosure framework has been closely connected to the concepts and theoretical background with agency theory information asymmetry decision usefulness theory and stakeholder theory etc the most of these concepts and theoretical framework emphasizes on separation of ownership from the management where the management is responsible for the operation of the organization while having responsibility of informing all the stakeholders regarding the progress and the performance of the business entity itself therefore financial reporting emerged as a one of the key important element in the modern business world where various important aspects in financial reporting evolved such as independency transparency informativeness usefulness creditworthiness decision supportiveness relevance comparability and consciousness etc to name few of them the expectation gap between the prepares and the users of the financial reporting over a period of long time has become one of the reasons for constant evolution and dynamism of the subjectthe harmonization of financial reportingthe world is still diverse and various institutions constituencies and practices are greatly influenced by different social legal political and economic factors so as financial reporting however world trade even with temporary cyclical ups and downs has been moving towards significant integration with ever increasing cross broader transactions we have witnessed various cross border ipos share buybacks ma multiple listing of business entities in various stock exchanges andemergence of institutional investors with different risk appetites having keen interests in emerging and frontier markets etc therefore such cross border activities demands harmonization of financial reporting across the borders the comparability of financial information for rational economic decision making purposes for investor community having diverse investments in different jurisdictions has become a compelling demand in the last century the harmonization of financial reporting across the world not only attracted the attention of the users significant amount of work has been put in place towards this direction in the recent pastempirical research findingsthere has been accounting research work in the recent past to understand the impact brings into capital markets through financial reporting harmonization it is imperative to find measures or parameters of evidences regarding the impact to capital markets through harmonization of financial reporting in the accounting research arena direct impact on capital market characteristics such as liquidity cost of capital bidask spread and improvement in foreign equity and debt participation through financial reporting are measured further indirect impact on capital markets such as informativeness of earning announcements and analysts forecast accuracy etc also identified further some researchers suggest that quantitative features of the capital market such as impact on number of issuers and composition of market segments etc also should be considered even though there are limited number of research available in that spacein one of the research it was unraveled that the information content on earning announcements observed an improvement through the reduction in reporting time lags increase in investments by foreign participants and improvement in accuracy of forecasts of the analyst during post adoption of ifrs compared to pre adoptionbeuselinck khurana van der meulen concluded that as a result of adoption of ifrs there was an improvement in disclosures of new information about a firm which reduced the surprise element of the disclosed information one of the important findings of this study is that since research was conducted among firms within eu countries the strong and transparent enforcement mechanism was prevalent in those markets therefore the findings of this study may not be applicable for countries with less enforcement mechanismsin another research study cai and wong however focused on g countries supported the belief that capital markets improved the level of integration post adoption of the ifrs in comparison to preadoption period the one of the main revelation was that the adoption of ifrs tends to reduce diversity in accounting practices which helps to facilitate efficient movement of capitalhowever in another study on the effect of adopting ifrs on integration of gulf countries capital marketsalnodel a found that the adoption of the ifrs has no significant influence on the integration of the capital markets it was further observed that the capital markets do not have any longterm relationship among each other interestingly results of this study contradicted the wildly held view that adopting ifrs improves capital markets integration it is important to note that this study stressed on other institutional elements which affect the influence of the accounting standards on capital markets integration it may important to understand the religious influences on the legal framework as wellin a study conducted in global space consisting firms within countries drake myers yao it was found that the mandatory adoption of ifrs results in increased market liquidity reflected in share turnover market depth and bidask spreads was attributable to the improvement in comparability of accounting information rather than quality effectof the accountingit was found that that there was an increase in stock trading activity in the frankfurt stock exchange after the mandatory adoption of the ifrs this research br ggemann u was conducted with firms from countries across the world it was further concluded that adoption of ifrs promotes more foreign investments in equity unfortunately this study did not analyze other factors that can influence foreign investmentsanother study conducted by chen tsang july with firms from countries established that firms mandatorily adopted ifrs have a higher likelihood to cross list as well as a large increase in crosslisting target countries compared to firms which do not adopt ifrs it was further found that firms from countries mandatorily adopted ifrs are likely to cross list their stocks in countries which mandate ifrs adoption and also has high capital markets liquiditythere was an interesting revelation in a study hong hung lobo where it was found that significant statistical and economical reductions in underpricing of ipos among countries which mandatorily adopted ifrs together with high increase in the funds raised in foreign markets as result of reduced information asymmetry through higher comparability of financial reports it was further analyzed that such relationships were strong for firms in countries with high creditability in accounting changes implementationa study concluded with firms from countries yu g observed that harmonization of accounting standards results in reducing information asymmetry promoting crossborder investment activities emanating from reduction in information processing costs for public financial statements and reduction of private information barriers this study further supports that ifrs adoption results in more ma activities often associated with high premium on takeoverit was established that increase in economic growth and international capital markets has been possible through the elimination of trade barriers in raising of capital across international markets by research conducted in bangladeshqurashi islam they found that the elimination of preparation of multiple financial statements cater to various stock exchanges through ifrs adoption facilitated the firms to get into capital markets across the borders this developing country experience in ifrs adoption has been further confirmed by tyrall woodward rakhimbekova in kazakhstan even though benefits experienced slowit was established that the cross border ma activities supposed to be higher in countries with higher similarity in accounting standards and increasing volume of ma activities usually driven by strong ifrs implementation enforcement in target countries in an examination conducted in countries covering the period from to francis huang khurana in a study florou pope consists of firms from countries covering the period from to found that adoption of ifrs influences the resource allocation of institutional investors however they established that such relationship exists when there is strict application of laws and with lower level of corruption onlya review conducted between and louren o branco revealed that in general adoption of ifrs results in improving accounting quality increasing ability of predicting by market analysts improving comparability and better use of accounting information however it was established that country and company factors has a major role on such relationship they concluded that management incentives and institutional factors would influence financial reporting therefore such factors can be regarded as important prerequisites in creating common business languagein an examination bae tan welker conducted with firms from countries it was found that closeness of various domestic gaaps to ifrs closely related to likelihood of foreign analysts following such firms and higher ability to provided more accurate forecasts for those companiesa study defond hu hung li surveyed foreign mutual fund investments they observed that the adoption of ifrs leads to comparability of financial reports only in countries that have credible implementation of the standards they further noted that improvements supposed to be strong in firmswhich use same accounting standard in the same industry they concluded that adopting ifrs mandatorily in nations having a strong credibility of implementation of standards experience a higher level of foreign ownership in the mutual fundsthe impact of ifrs adoption on capital markets was evaluated by proch zka pel k and observed that the within eu post ifrs adoption results were mixed and therefore they believed that generalization such as adoption of ifrs would eventually lead to developments and improvements in capital markets were not suitable proposition for eu territory they stressed that country specific regulation also should be considereda study with a firms from eu during to li shroff revealed that there was a reduction in cost of capital during the post adoption of ifrs period it was however found that such reduction in cost of capital only happened in markets with strong legal enforcement mechanismhope et al established that countries with a relatively weak investor protection are more likely to adopt ifrsthe study of ramanna and sletten concluded that strong economies are reluctant to hand the power over standardsetting to independent international authority ramanna and sletten further found out the degree of ifrs harmonisation of a particular country increases in the perceived value of its ifrs network high value of the network effects can however result in adopting the accounting rules which do not suit well to domestic institutions in fact some countries adopt ifrs even if it leads to replacement of comparatively superior local standards by ifrsconcluding remarkseven though there are research studies with regard to financial reporting harmonization through ifrs adoption and its impact on capital markets most of such research work brings in empirical evidence of an effect of ifrs adoption in a positive or mixed manner however it is important to draw attention to the fact that some of the studies emphasis on positive effect on ifrs adoption subject to a number of factors affecting this effect particularly company s characteristics and countries characteristics etc further it is important to understand that most number of research studies have been on developed countries whereas only fewer research work are on developing countries the impact on financial reporting harmonization through ifrs adoption on capital markets in developed markets may be different to that of developing markets specifically where strong legal enforcement framework exists in developed markets compared to developing furthermore suitability of ifrs framework to developing markets also questioned in very few research workfinally ifrs framework would complement the socioeconomic political and legal enforcement strengths of a jurisdiction together with strengths ethical and governance framework of business organizations rather than act as a substitute of such factorsthe author is the chief financial officer of commercial bank of ceylon plc and a member of the institute of chartered accountants

by jekhan aruliahi must first congratulate the sri lanka tourist development authority sltda before i criticise it just a few days after the publication of my article in june complaining their sri lanka tourist attractions map showed nothing in the northern province other than jaffna s airport the sltda replaced that barren old mapthe new july map shown above next to the june one shows a definite pink sprinkle of tourist attraction dots in the far north this is better than the old map that showed nothing except jaffna s airportdisappointingly when i took a closer look at the map the jaffna mainland s sights did not include the nallur temple nor the jaffna fort for the sltda s map to forget both these iconic jaffna sights is a sign of great carelessness borne presumably out of innocent ignorance an ignorance that is unbecoming of our country s apex tourism authority suggesting it itself hasn t toured like a tourist in the north missing the nallur temple in jaffna is like missing the eiffel tower in paris or forgetting london s big ben sydney s opera house and new york s empire state buildingat the time of writing this article the sltda map showed distant delft island having the greatest number of attractions crediting it with tourist highlights including wild ponies and a very large tree outnumbering the tourist highlights it identified in the jaffna mainland this sloppy attempt at showcasing jaffna s tourist attractions smacks of a quick google before lunch of peninsular sights ordered alphabetically d for delft getting alphabetic priority over f for fort j for jaffna or n for nallur i hope by the time you read this article the sltda will have fixed these omissions but it is sadly typical that the colombo based agencies only look north fleetingly only when prodded to do so and after only a fleeting glimpse north they turn back southto understand delft island s unreadiness for tourism the sltda need only go to its own website and read its own description of the place there are two ferry services per day one in the morning and other one in the afternoon but it is advisable to check first before planning your trip the schedule is subject to significant changes due to weather conditions and boat conditions on arriving at the island there is only one bus available go and go sic on the single road it is probably advisable to hire a tractor that can take you on a more detailed route delft which i have yet to visit is doubtless a charming island but to set it up as the pinnacle of northern tourism implying the rest of the north is downhill from there is not doing us any favoursso what does the sltda need to do suresh murugaser a colombo based entrepreneur said personally having been involved in the tourism industry for many decades in the past i feel that the north is a magical place that needs to be put on the sri lanka tourist map i think a first step should be for the sltpb sri lanka tourism promotion board to take local tour operators on factfinding missions so that they can familiarise themselves with the product without that essential first step nothing can be done for me being an optimistic pessimist searching for a silver lining at least this new interactive map shows the sltda is trying fitfully to move in the right direction one hopes the sltda will listen to people like murugaser and will commission some proper touristic exploring in the north one hopes they will also seek suggestions from those who wish the north well to add to their map of tourist attractions to start them off here are some emailed responses i received to my earlier article there are also some coral reefs in the north completely untouched by tourism the coral reefs i ve snorkelled in hikkaduwa and trincomalee are severely bleached due to the amount of tourist traffic while the nature lover in me hopes for the northern reefs to be left alone if approached in a environmentally conscious way the northern reefs have huge potential in particular if local fishermen are involved it could take advantage of their significant knowledge while addressing the ever present problem of over fishing via providing an alternate source of income the jaffna fish market while not being as big as its southern counterparts would still be fascinating for a foreign tourist who would never have seen sting rays drying or squid that has just been speared a few eateries close to the fish market would do very well if there was enough interest in visiting the market itself you need a decent air service one indirect flight via trinco a few times a week is not enough you could do with a decent train service including a proper sleeper carriage charging tourists enough to be a money making venture after all they are saving a night in a hotel and will be happy to pay good money for a comfortable night on a train i see many more advantages than disadvantages to reestablishing the talaimannarrameshwaram ferry service it would breathe economic life into mannar where the economic situation is desperate a direct train link which i understand is under construction from mannar to jaffna would help the north to benefit from the ferry traffic casuarina beach is unique for the very reason that you could literally walk out meters into the sea while never being more than chest high and facing the gentlest waves in all of sri lanka its basically a giant pool which doesn t require a life guard i can only imagine that would delight sinhalese tourists many of them can t swim that spend their time visiting southern beaches wishfully looking at the unfriendly water you need to get the guide books and tour companies on side the majority of high end tourists are led by their noses by travel agents this excellent looking video is by rupavahini it s in sinhala so i don t understand a word it would be nice if english and tamil versions were available httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv nuu zghwqy hikkaduwe is one of the early tourist spots developed to promote tourism in the south this is a good example of unplanned development today it s a bad example for sri lanka this place is mainly for drugs and all sorts of vices under the sun unless jaffna develops tourism in a well planned way and attract high end tourists who want clean beaches good food etc etc the journey to kayts via the causeway during sunset with the sky sea merging is magical that s jaffna an unpolished gem resume the suspended jaffnatiruchirapalli airlink air asia malindo has flights dailyfrom kuala lumpur to tiruchirapalli until we can write up a day night programme for jaffna including but not limited to a spa visit or two a swim snorkel or dive a couple of good restaurants and bars in the night and some shopping we have no chance of attracting a stream of tourists i would encourage readers to add their suggestions in the comments section below this articlejekhan s suggested day tour to the north itinerarypicking up on that last comment about the day night programme here is an itinerary based on my own wanderings over the last couple of yearsin this itinerary i have assumed travel by car or privately hired coach the timings assume travelling without getting lost or stuck in traffic if you travel in a party of over you can get extremely good deals in the posh hotels during low season which in the north seems to be

by dr ganeshan wignarajahfixing sri lanka s labour market comparative lessons july lbo the recently published sri lanka development update by the world bank focuses on creating more and better jobs for an upper middleincome sri lanka it usefully analyses the state of sri lanka s labour market and identifies challenges to attaining this development goal the world bank report s deep dive into the issue of women s labour force participation in sri lanka including in postconflict areas is particularly thoughtprovoking the report also reiterates the world bank s usual macroeconomic narrative about slow growth and lacklustre progress in economic reforms in my view sri lanka s experience does not tally with the typical arthur lewis model in which surplus labour moves from the lowproductivity rural sector to drive the expansion of a highproductivity modern sector today sri lanka has a paradoxical combination of slow growth in the first quarter of and labour scarcity a low unemployment rate of in a tight labour market means that the private sector is increasingly starved for skilled labour although several international and domestic factors are shackling sri lanka s growth the labour market deserves special attention the time is ripe for a few wellimplemented measures to increase labour market flexibility and boost growth the private sector has to raise its game too four kinds of labour market issues merit serious discussion in sri lanka first the world bank report rightly identifies the need to raise female participation rates to increase sri lanka s labour supply amidst its transition to an ageing population nobel laureate amartya sen candidly observed that investing a dollar in girls secondary education provides the best social return on development finance in this vein japan is trying to increase female participation rates as a part of the socalled abenomics structural reforms affordable child care is a key need including in subsidised nurseries at large private firms and communityrun creches at the villagelevel to encourage mothers to return to work the top sri lankan firms should unilaterally set the example and others are likely to follow another need is ending harassment of women at the workplace and on transport through a meto social media movement with compulsory workplace training in both the private and public sectorssecond while the mismatch in available and required skills in the private sector is mentioned in the world bank report a missing issue is the poor english language ability of workers which hampers labour productivity in the country s growing services sector when wages rose in bangalore s global it hub a decade ago indian firms did not come to neighbouring sri lanka partly due to a shortage of ample supplies of english speaking graduates instead indian it firms went to the philippines to set up shop the language problem is compounded by a lack of competent english teachers a radical solution from east asia is to import lowcost but competent english teachers from the philippines on shortterm work visas under a technical cooperation arrangement a similar scheme may be developed for importing chinese teachers given a growing chinese tourist and investor presence in sri lanka and a dearth of chinesespeaking local workers and managers third the world bank report discusses the unemployment of arts graduates almost half of university graduates in were from an academic programme in the arts this indicates a poor return on costly educational investments at the tertiarylevel and a source of social distress which have propelled two youth insurrections in southern sri lanka as a part of their recruitment efforts on university campuses the private sector should offer paid internships during university holidays to provide a taste of what it really means to work in a competitive business these internships should also become a compulsory part of all degree courses university careers services should be properly resourced and forge links with the private sector and state institutions furthermore charging even affordable modest fees for university education would attune young minds to job market prospects it might also reduce incentives for antisocial behaviour like ragging and unjustified student protests finally the cost of a bloated public sector accounting for of employment receives scant mention in the world bank report the public sector has historically been the employer of choice for the average graduate due to lifetime employment and a pension but fiscal constraints linked to a high debt to gdp ratio of about means that this is increasingly unsustainable the new zealand example of trimming the public sector may be instructive reforms there included a combination of a national publicsector employment audit natural departures due to early retirement a redundancyretraining scheme increased lateral entry from outside and introducing new technologies salaries were also raised for remaining civil servants that provided incentives for improved productivity and service delivery whatever reform is possible within current political circumstance it should be gradually implemented over a decade decades of providing free education and health care along with food subsidies gave sri lanka a reputation for being a success story among developing countries in providing basic needs with an ample supply of cheap literate and productive labour this helped to attract exportoriented foreign investment to the clothing industry and created about jobs after the country opened up in but the reputation of sri lankan labour may be at risk following a year civil war alternative spending priorities and growing institutional imperfections combining private sector action with labour market reforms can help put sri lanka firmly on the road to uppermiddle income statusdr ganeshan wignaraja is chair of the global economy programme at the lakshman kadirgamar

by ajita kadirgamarjuly lbo long before the advent of the internet social media and professional networking sites such as linkedin sri lankans were masters of the networking game networking whether social or professional is basically the exchange of information and ideas among individuals or groups that share a common interest it has evolved into an art a delicate mix of give and take you scratch my back i ll scratch yours it s also a sense of alone we can do so little together we can do so much perhaps sri lankans are good at networking because we are a small island where everyone knows someone who s someone and let s face it our people excel at making everybody s business their business master networkermy father lakshman kadirgamar was possibly one of the most prolific networkers dare i say in sri lankan history from nursery school at ladies college to trinity college kandy to the university of peradeniya baliol college the oxford union the un ilo wipo and during his years in politics he tapped into his prolific network at a personal level he used his network to help young people with their education and jobs support charitable projects and of course he was ever willing to rally the troops to support his beloved alma mater trinitythe man had access to a massive global network of professionals academics and politicians and wherever in the world he travelled he was bound to know someone from way back he fastidiously nurtured his friendships and relationships over the decades and was a great note and letter writer always handwritten something we rarely do today he had the oldworld habit of writing thank you notes for the smallest good deed or gift that came his way such demonstrations of grace and courtesy mattered deeply and were treasured by the receiverapart from written communication he could effortlessly pick up the phone and connect directly to the movers and shakers of the world in fact he could have been the preinternet poster boy for what linkedin has become to the world of professional networkingthe abundant networking my father consciously undertook during his lifetime with merely a collection of business cards or telephone numbers is what we do today at lightning speed through the internet networking for the unemployedwhile unemployed in the us at the height of the economic crisis i found out firsthand the importance of having a diverse network blindly applying for jobs online and never hearing back soon became a futile task i rapidly grew my linkedin account attended networking meetings for the unemployed went to free seminars and social events did a pro bono project and joined interest groups not only did all this activity keep me busy and stave off jobloss depression but every person i met was a possible link to a future jobin fact once when invited to address a group of unemployed networkers i told them that if i as a foreigner in the country could have done all of the above there was no excuse for them as citizens on their home turf to sit around moping about the lack of traction in their job search i pointed out that anyone in their immediate sphere neighbour postman mechanic friend of a friend could end up providing a crucial link to their next job they were receptive and grateful for my outsider perspectivewhen job hunting knowing someone in the targeted company is what will get you a foot in the door and the possibility of an interview companies always prefer hiring through personal recommendations if this sounds like a typical sri lankan practice which is effective because this is such a small country and everyone knows everyone be assured it s how it works even in the us school networksthe sri lankan old boys and old girls school networks classic buddy systems are priceless both at home and abroad in australia for instance with its massive sri lankan community of around every leading school has an alumni group or association in sydney alone i ve attended events by old trinitians peradeniya university alumni and a very well fraternized good shepherd dinner dance where i even met a distant relative for the first timesuch events not only keep the sri lankan community connected while far from the motherland many also raise funds for charitable projects back home alumni networks are priceless because members are bound together by a common love pride and the desire to share their good fortune and give backwherever in the world you find a significant sri lankan community you can be sure there will be some sort of association where people gather regularly for the obligatory lankan food arrack baila music and juicy gossip social mediawhile social media is the ultimate form of virtual networking sri lankans have created their special recipe of get togethers under the banner tweetupsl what started off as a casual meetup between three twitter contacts in has morphed into a network of over tweeps an annual event including awards for the most popular tweeps in various categories as well as smaller regular interesteventbased meetings in colombo and kandy interestingly members range from school kids to senior citizens one facebook forum with members is planning its first social later in the month and it will be interesting to see how many members turn up in the flesh for sri lankans there s nothing quite like meeting face to face and figuring out real life connections and commonalitiesnetworking today is an intuitive activity whether we realize it or not every interaction every business card handed out is a potential resource that can be of use somewhere down the line the cardinal rule of networking however is to cultivate and grow your network in good times not wait till desperate times to reach out for help advice or a job

 affirms at aaalka july lbo fitch ratings has removed the rating watch negative on distilleries company s national longterm rating and has affirmed the rating at aaalka full text of the statement is reproduced belowfitch ratingscolombo july fitch ratings has removed the rating watch negative rwn on distilleries company of sri lanka plc s dist national longterm rating and has affirmed the rating at aaalka the outlook is stablethe removal of the rwn reflects our view that dist and parent melstacorp plc have effectively concluded the group s restructuring exercise without an increase in credit risk after the private placement of dist shares to melstacorp in february melstacorp which owns of dist has yet to meet the requirement set by the colombo stock exchange to increase the company s public float to from but we think this is more of a formality at this stagefitch rates dist based on the consolidated profile of melstacorp due to the strong linkages between the two entities as defined in our parent and subsidiary rating linkage criteria the affirmation of dist s national longterm rating reflects the group s strong credit profile underpinned by its entrenched market position in sri lanka s alcoholicbeverage sector and the high entry barriers which drive strong operating cash flows and low leverage and offset the weaknesses in its other less operationally significant investmentsdist s rating also factors in the group s enhanced operating scale and cash flow diversity following the increase in its effective shareholding and management control of aitken spence plc asp to in march from previously fitch believes dist s rating has a higher tolerance for leverage defined as lease adjusted debt net of cashoperating ebitdar following the acquisition and we have increased the leverage threshold above which the rating could be negatively impacted to x from x to reflect this we proportionately consolidate asp s financials with that of melstacorp in arriving at the rating to reflect our view that melstacorp may provide support to asp in a hypothetical distressed scenario only to the extent of its proportionate shareholding in light of asp s large public floatkey rating driversstrong linkages with parent there are strong operational and legal linkages between dist and melstacorp s subsidiaries and dist accounted for an estimated of melstacorp s consolidated revenue and of its ebitdar excluding melstacorp s insurance subsidiary in the financial year to march fy dist and melstacorp share the same board of directors and dist has previously provided financial support to weaker group entities in the form of corporate guaranteesasp improves business risks we believe the combined credit profile of melstacorp and asp is among the top tier of sri lankan corporates for credit quality we have assessed asp s standalone credit profile as slightly weaker than that of dist due to asp s exposure to segments with more volatile cash flows such as leisure and plantations and asp s slightly higher leverage x in fy this is offset by the greater diversification of melstacorp s earnings and larger operating scale as a result of the combinationmelstacorp s consolidated earnings continue to be underpinned by the strong alcoholicbeverage sector which we expect to account for more than of the proportionately consolidated ebitda of the combined group in the medium termmargin to improve we expect the group s ebitdar margin to rise by around bp in fy fy as we forecast dist s standalone ebitdar margin will recover to around from fy due to better sourcing strategies dist s ebitdar margin rose to in qfy after falling to around in the first three quarters of fy fy fy average due to higher costs as a result of a doubling of import duty on ethanol a key input in we also believe dist will be able to pass on higher costs as we do not foresee a significant increase in excise duty levied on hard liquor over the medium termleverage to peak in fy we expect melstacorp s leverage including its share of asp s net debt and ebitda to peak at x in fy fy estimate x mainly due to large capex plans at asp s power and leisure segments leverage is also high at the group s telecom subsidiary lanka bell limited and plantation subsidiaries we expect lanka bell to continue incurring high capex as it expands its g coverage volatile tea and rubber prices continue to affect the group s plantation business although revenue improved in fy leading alcoholicbeverage maker dist accounts for over of sri lanka s hardliquor production and has been able to maintain its market leadership due to its entrenched dcsl brand and access to a countrywide distribution network the complete advertising ban on alcoholic beverages acts as a high entry barrier and further strengthens dist s dominance however hardliquor makers volumes are likely to drop following the government s more favourable taxation policy towards beer makers from november we expect dist s volumes to remain flat in fy despite the policy given its strong market position and revenue to grow by lowsingle digits thereafter as it passes on higher input costsimportance to state revenue we expect the alcoholicbeverage sector s importance to government revenue to reduce the risk the government will hobble the industry incremental excise tax increases on hard liquor will likely be slow as prices beyond consumer affordability could lower the government s income excise taxes on liquor contributed an estimated to government tax revenue in with dist accounting for around half of this amountacquisitive nature event risk we believe the group s restructuring will allow management to increase its focus on acquisitions in nonalcoholic beverage segments melstacorp disposed of its investment in a fully owned licensed finance company melsta regal finance limited in march while it increased its stake in its plantationsector assets in september the group has historically pursued acquisitions actively and while it has not indicated any specific targets at present dist s rating could come under pressure if there are significant debtfunded acquisitions particularly those that weaken the group s overall business risk and increase cash flow volatilityderivation summarydist is sri lanka s leading alcoholicbeverage manufacturer with a strong portfolio of wellknown brands and access to an extensive distribution network dist s aaalka rated peers sri lanka telecom plc slt aaalkastable and dialog axiata plc aaalkastable enjoy a larger operating scale reflecting the size of the local telecom market and the companies market leadership in fixed line and mobile respectively dist s operating scale is smaller because a significant portion of the country s alcoholicbeverage consumption occurs outside the formal sector which is not recordeddist is also exposed to more regulatory risk in the form of increases in indirect taxation but these risks are counterbalanced by its entrenched market position and high entry barriers which allow the company to pass on cost inflation and maintain margins supporting substantially stronger free cash flows fcf than the telcos dist s capex as a proportion of revenue is also considerably lower than the telcos and most of dist s investments in other businesses are discretionary the telcos high capex intensity is driven by the need to continually upgrade infrastructure and keep abreast of evolving technology and to service growing network traffic while competition keeps tariff increases in check resulting in larger and more sustained negative fcf than distkey assumptionsfitch s key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include consolidated revenue to grow by midsingle digits in fy before increasing to highsingle digits over fy fy consolidated ebitdar margin to improve in fy on the back of improving alcoholbeverage segment margins fy lower excise tax hikes as the government would be mindful of falling revenue collection if demand were to decline capex to peak at lkr billion in fy mainly on account of power and leisure segmentrelated capex by asp a group dividend payout of of net profit over

july lbo sri lanka s expresident mahinda rajapaksa alleges the government for what he called fleecing the public through fuel price manipulation using a price formula which nobody has seenrajapaksa says even though this kind of price manipulation is a standard practice in the largescale retail industry it is quite clear that the government is aiming to collect more tax revenue from fuel by increasing and reducing fuel prices frequently the public should also take note of the devious manner in which the government implemented the fuel price increase the indian oil company was first allowed to increase their prices while the ceylon petroleum corporation held back rajapaksa said after a few days when the people had reconciled themselves to a fuel price increase the government increased the prices at the cpc stations as well they sought to diffuse public outrage by such means such practices are all part of a government strategy to fleece the public through the manipulation of fuel prices full statementfleecing the public through fuel price manipulationfuel prices have been increased yet again within a period of about eight weeks a situation we have never experienced earlier now the price of petrol is rs and diesel rs while today s price of crude oil in the world market is around usd per barrel in when sri lanka was buying crude oil at the much higher rate of usd a barrel petrol was sold at rs and diesel at rs during the nine years in which we ruled the country world crude oil prices were always high according to the central bank reports when i first assumed office as president back in november crude oil was imported to sri lanka at around usd per barrel thereafter the price of crude oil increased steadily and during the last four years of my government in and the average price of crude oil imports was over usd per barrel hence the present crude oil price of usd is very low compared to the prices that prevailed when we were in powerthe government should explain to the public why the retail price of fuel is disproportionately high today the latest price increase is being justified in terms of a price formula which nobody has seen it is quite clear that this government is aiming to collect more tax revenue from fuel by increasing and reducing fuel prices frequently so that at the end of the year more revenue would have been collected from consumers this kind of price manipulation is a standard practice in the large scale retail industry the public should also take note of the devious manner in which the government implemented the fuel price increase the indian oil company was first allowed to increase their prices while the ceylon petroleum corporation held back after a few days when the people had reconciled themselves to a fuel price increase the government increased the prices at the cpc stations as well they sought to diffuse public outrage by such means such practices are all part of a government strategy to fleece the public through the manipulation of fuel pricesmahinda rajapaksa former president of sri lanka

jul lbo sri lanka s prime minister said that the island needs to reconsider the structure of it s local governments as concepts such as megacities and global connectivity come into play the biggest issue in the management of megacities is that they involve many levels of government and local authorities prime minister ranil wickremesinghe said political power in many of our countries were distributed between the central government the provinces and the local authorities in the last century when concepts such as megacities and global connectivity had not even been thought of given that he says we will now have to exercise these powers for completely different objectives in a completely different environment it is inevitable then that we must reconsider the structure of our local governments for sri lanka or any other country to deal with these challenges we need to politically and financially revitalize and empower local governments he was delivering the keynote address titled livable and sustainable cities of the future transcending challenges of the anthropocene at the world cities summit international water week and cleanenviro summit in singapore mondayfull text of the speech follows i am grateful to the government of singapore and the sponsoring agencies the centre for livable cities the national water agency the ministry of environment and the national environmental agency for inviting our delegation to the th world cities summit cleanenviro summit and international water week attending this conference brings to mind the singapore of which i have seen through photographs and newsreels it was just another asian city impressive colonial buildings stood alongside squalid urban slums filled by the poor and unemployed years later singapore offers the best quality of life of all asian cities according to mercer s quality of life survey of course singapore did not reach this status autonomously the late prime minister lee kwan yew envisioned and executed its transformation into a smart secure and livable city a standard of distinction being that a woman can walk alone safely without being violated anytime of day or night as asia s best example of a wellmanaged metropolitan environment singapore shows us a path to successfully build large yet livable cities given this is a tangible challenge of our times providing leadership to this biannual conference is testimony to your achievements i use the term anthropocene to describe the times we live in because it is an era indelibly shaped by human activity one such incredibly influential activity has been our largescale migration from the countryside to the city thus the anthropocene is fundamentally marked by urbanization data from the world bank shows that in of the world s population that is billion people lived in urban areas this has happened because around the world urbanization has been a transformative trend that has propelled economic growth by bringing people and enterprises together large cities have become centres of industrialisation and modernisation they have reaped the benefits of economies of agglomeration when firms and workers cluster together there is improved productivity and job creation megacities have gone one step further they have become highly productive centres which connect workers and businesses with global markets cities therefore have become hubs of wealth creation attracting waves of people with opportunities for advancement not available in their villages of course the allure of urban life also resulted in the unexpectedly rapid and therefore unplanned expansion of cities in south and south east asia this in turn created challenges of congestion immense population pressures on infrastructure basic services land housing and the environment apart from constraining the benefits of agglomeration these pressures also reduce the quality of life of a city s residents it leaves them unable to access sanitation sewage transport and decent housing it condemns them to breathing polluted air and to drinking contaminated water it leaves their homes and lives vulnerable to the ravages of climate change and natural disasters and compels them to create subcultures in a city s underbelly as ghettos gangs drug traffickers transient communities etc these opportunities and challenges are magnified in asia multicity agglomerations the beijing tianjin qinhuangdao corridor has a population of over million i can see a future where a sprawl of mega urban centres stretches from beijing to bangkok to jakarta to mumbai although cities across asia are growing apace only three singapore tokyo and kobe are in the top of the mercer quality of life index colombo was the highest ranked south asian city but still only stood at out of cities at least asian cities are in the bottom of this ranking our challenge as leaders is to make these asian cities livable for the present and the future the sustainable development of our globe depends on whether we succeed or fail asian urban centers are taking the lead in integrating their national economies with global value and supply chains metropolitan regions with mega infrastructure is the key to transnational connectivity that enables global economic integration sri lanka s longterm objective envisages exploiting our strategic location in the indian ocean to ensure our economic development in a region which will be pivotal for global economic growth by the population in the littoral states of bay of bengal that is in the east indian ocean alone will be billion the key thrust of the sri lanka initiative will be the western megapolis and the two connecting corridor which will cover million people the mega infrastructure includes the development of the ports of colombo and hambantota in the south the new landfill adjacent to the colombo port is planned as an offshore financial centre four special economic zones will provide the infrastructure for industry we envision the western province of sri lanka which includes colombo and the capital sri jayewardenepura as a megapolis of interconnected metropolitan areas this would include a light railway system with elevated railways elevated highways a multimodal transport hub the development of old waterways and lng plants it will encompass a logistics city a forest city and an aero city we will aim for maximum livability by implementing sewerage and solid waste projects an eco zone and riverine buffer zone development plans for the megapolis were prepared by surbana jurong and the ministry of megapolis are in the initial stages of implementation we will also develop two urban corridors one along the kmlong central expressway leading to kandy and the other along the kmlong southern highway via galle leading to the newly built hambantota port and mattala airport the southern corridor will include large eco friendly tourist resorts of over acres each in addition to a fully restored galle heritage fort surbana jurong is also planning the development of hambantota cities and megacities are characterized by wealth creation led by private investment but this economic process often excludes the interests and viewpoints of marginalized groups such as women the elderly children youth the disabled and the poor therefore to ensure inclusiveness we have designed our housing policies based on three prongs redevelopment relocation and consolidation the first prong refers to converting potentially valuable underused urban land assets into better housing commercial and service spaces with community involvement in planning the second prong is about relocating communities living on hazardprone land or lands required for essential infrastructure development the final prong is to legally and socially recognise settlements in colombo that have been upgraded with secure tenure services and habitable housing but are still stigmatized as underserved settlements we must recognise that our cities cannot stand in isolation they depend on their hinterland for the provision of the ecosystem services in sri lanka water has become the most critical of these ecosystem services the challenge for the ancient kingdoms was to manage the vast volumes of water made available by the monsoons the rainwater was conserved in artificial ponds and manmade reservoirs for drinking and irrigation which remain serviceable to this day in recent years possibly due to global climate change while sri lanka s annual precipitation is falling the frequency of extreme events is increasing this is further aggravated by the rising population and industrialization of the southwest the result has been disastrous lives livelihoods and property have been lost with disturbing regularity through floods and landslides water today is a foe in fact the tsunami made the sea our enemy as well these are all perceptions based on some very valid fears so how can we overcome them with respect to water management singapore is truly leading the field singapore has tried to maximize aquifer retention within its own territory from its first national development plan but wisely also struck an agreement with neighbouring johor state in southern malaysia for water supply singapore is also a benchmark in desalination and potable quality recycling of wastewater this enlightened and frugal attitude is epitomized by newater the reclaimed water produced by singapore s public utilities board we can all learn a great deal from singapore in their wise management of this critical input for livability and development thus the task of building livable and sustainable cities require integrating with global supply chains social inclusivity and access to new and old ecosystem services there are already examples we can learn from let me use the sinosingapore tianjin ecocity as an example here it assimilated singaporean and chinese industry thereby it integrates with global supply chains it subsidises public housing and tries to eliminate barriers for the elderly and the disabled thereby it seeks to be social inclusive finally it invests in integrated wastewater treatment and nontraditional water sources like desalination thereby it pushes sustainable ecosystem services global leaders must take note of the successes and failures of cities such as this for sri lanka or any other country to deal with these challenges we need to politically and financially revitalize and empower local governments the biggest issue in the management of megacities is that they involve many levels of government and local authorities political power in many of our countries were distributed between the central government the provinces and the local authorities in the last century when concepts such as megacities and global connectivity had not even been thought of given that we will now have to exercise these powers for completely different objectives in a completely different environment it is inevitable then that we must reconsider the structure of our local governments as we continue to face these traditional challenges we must also be aware of the new developments in urbanization which will characterize the anthropocene in the st century one characteristic of highdensity living is the opportunity for a wide variety of

july lbo secretary to the president and lifelong public servant austin fernando s farewell speech reproduced in full from the colombo telegraphborn on th june having had my primary education at hikkaduwa sinhala school postprimary education at richmond college galle i was admitted to university of ceylon peradeniya in july as a young graduate i entered the teaching profession in may and joined the ceylon administrative service cas in october starting my new cas career in batticaloa district i had an extremely eventful and memorable stint in the public service i was appointed a secretary of a ministry at the young age of although it was an enviable age to rise to such position i also experienced the departure from public service in an abrupt manner in august at the unripe age of when i did depart the service in i did so to uphold my unwavering principle of integrity it repeated in november julone would envy that for sure but this experience was also for the best due to my employment in the private sector i was able to fund my daughter s education in pakistan which i was finding difficult as a government servant today when i see her carrying out her post graduate education at university of oxford i reflect that being removed from government service at that time was a blessing today too i leave with the conviction that everything happens for the best in i left government service keeping my uncontested integrity intact this time in my departure may also seem abrupt to you many may interpret it in different ways social media have been discussing it for some time now but it was discussed and agreed with his excellency the president on nd of may at his office i leave today at the mature age of at the world is a philosophical place free man with a free consciencesince i joined the public sector twice from the private sector in december as secretary defense and as advisor and governor of eastern province in january following as secretary to he the president in july the last position is the peak a public officer could reach in public service it is a respected sought after esteemed position a jewel on a crown i have pleasant and unpleasant memories of my present tenure i will not discuss the unpleasant memories some of the memories encouraged me to leave public service and reminded me that the time has come for me to leave the secretariat my thankful gratitude goes to two private sector organizations that gave me shelter when i needed it most the resources development consultants ltd for years plus and japann international cooperation agency sri lanka office for years for a mere clerk s son without any political social or ancestral ties to reach the apex position in public service proves that sri lanka is a country of opportunity if one has perseverance efficiency and integrity i have done my part with total integrity impartially without malice towards anyone even when i had been illtreated misunderstood penalized slandered etc tomorrow the same slandering and insults will begin but i shall remove them from my heart with a smile reflecting that this is the nature of the world since i have no ill earned assets from irregular means and i have not been part to murder torture disappearances or wrongful punishment of any person tomorrow i can walk on any street anywhere without security personnel surrounding me even in the times i was provided a large number of security personnel i used them to the minimal i am a free man with a free conscience i am finally free straight line in the ecg means you are deadthe indian business tycoon ratan tata said ups and downs in life are very important to keep us going because a straight line even in an ecg means we are not alive i was alive always and full of life and vigor and went on to work late hours carry on with long meetings and continued at home too when there was an overflow of files from office the delay of a file in my room would have been always less than hours if there were delays those were connected to payment of public monies i was the chief accounting officer of this secretariat i engaged in difficult tasks related to constructive actions by this government i was a member of the working group that drafted the concept paper and an outline of the draft legislation for the creation of the office of the missing person i chaired the working group that drafted the concept paper and an outline of the draft legislation for the reparation mechanism to be presented before the parliament soon i contributed to the sub committee where preparatory work was done for the parliamentary steering committee in formulating a new constitution for sri lanka i am a great believer of reconciliation democracy and good governance and this was a reason why i committed for such endeavors i thank my betters and the officers of the statewhen i leave public life today after years since joining the teaching profession i have to appreciate many greats such as ef dias abeysinghe dbips sirivardhane dharmasiri peiris bradman weerakoon shelton wanasinghe baku mahadeva minister gamani jayasuriya etc let me begin from the minor employees lower middle and nonexecutive grades of officers like others who stood with me through thick and thin throughout my career even the smallest worker who have stuck with me through thick and thin have contributed my standing here today whether they are here or not i thank them all there were executive grade officials of various disciplines and services other than the sri lanka administrative service officers who gave their fullest to me i think them they all know that i did my best to uplift their professional conditions in fact i took the lead to implementing the monthly allowance of rupees for cabinet secretaries even for the ministry of justice i did the same with the support of hon attorney general and hon chief justice even if any other service justified such facility i would have assisted them as wellthroughout my career i have worked with nongovernmental organizations local and international diplomats civil society groups trade unions and associations media organizations religious dignitaries at the highest and local levels and their institutions legal personnel at various levels inclusive of the hon chief justice and judges of the superior courts hon attorney general independent commissions etc i am thankful to all of them for having given me their best professional support when i needed it most i thank themi have actively engaged in political activities from my young days when i was climbing the ladder in the public service i started disconnecting myself from political leadership it was because i was not entitled to political rights after joining ceylon administrative service i could therefore adjust myself without being attached to political ideologies i was acceptable to anyone and so much so i could be the defense secretary in a united national party unp led government in and the secretary to the president in led by the worst political rival of the unp my then engagement with the unp government has been used to interpret my current political leanings by some fake hangerson even after i took office as secretary to the president if the critics had read my book my belly is white and believe what i have said regarding my being appointed as the secretary of defense they would clearly understand the invalidity of such comments similarly some have been commenting of my alignment to the sri lanka freedom party because i have been appointed to my incumbent position by the president of the slfp the president is the best witness of what happened i am only a friend of this countryi have my great respect to the president and prime minister but i am not a political acolyte of their political parties i have associated the president and the prime minister for and years respectively as a friend of this country with a truthful independent voice when they were fighting for peace reconciliation good governance and social justice through their politics i had been helpful in their campaigns when they were not in power there were no large crowds that you see today at their homes and offices some of those gathered are the very people who were their bitter opponents but currently they enjoy exclusive posts and many worldly comforts when i started working for their governments as an officer i kept aloof from politics like a swan that separate milk from water i could separate politics from administration this has invited vitriolic criticism of me by those who do not understand the dynamics of governance without political servitude the state is a bigger concept than governmentin my public service career i have developed a rapport with party stalwarts from almost all political parties and they too looked up to me for clarifications on political history and constitution i could do this because in my heart my concerns were larger than politics my concern was whether something i was about to do or say was good for my country whether it was the just thing for all communities whether it would build peace and serenity whether it would enhance love and compassion to all whether it was environmentally friendly in my life my conscience and my service to my country have always been more important to me than individual politicians and political power remember the state is a bigger and greater concept than a government there is a difference may be the odd individual but i consider that these should be our mottos as public officers rather than to venerate the wrong with bent kneesfake hangers on two of the scourges of public service is the seniority preference and political patronage these scourges frustrate efficient productive officers with potential to serve the country better the fake hangers on are a nuisance to politicians as well as to the bureaucracy they have their personal or political agenda and try to put the politicians and bureaucrats to their own groove of thinking what should be done is to cut off these fake intruders for reasons and not cut real people for fake reasons it is those who protect fake hangers on and the institutions themselves that will suffer because of it in dealing with fake people i had a policy it was to be blunt as possible i know that sometimes i have hurt their feelings by being so i consider it as a strength but one may consider it as a weakness but my saying this today i have exhibited that i am unprepared to give up this good habit after all i may live a few years more and trying to change my good ways now at this late stage let me be the authentic austin fernandoformer indian elections commissioner tn sheshan in his book degeneration of india names politicians unpublic service judiciary and media as the four reasons for india s degeneration if you assume sri lanka s public service as unpublic then considering the criticisms on the other three components i feel that at least if the public service does not pick up sri lanka s degeneration will be inevitable it will be difficult to achieve if politicians public service leadership law enforcers judiciary media and civil society do not individually and severally shoulder the reformation process with vigorin i accepted the position of advisor to the president on the request of his excellency i accepted the post of governor eastern province on the recommendation of the prime minister and condoned by president while functioning as the governor i continued to advice the president as an honorary service on th april having evaded his request several times i gave in to the repeated request of his excellency and conceded to being appointed president s secretary the authenticity of this claim is well known by wjs karunarathne and mrs anuradha jayawickrama the one who laughs last laughs bestwhen i took up this job it was my intention to leave within a year or so since it should be taken over by a younger person for grand running i am happy that circumstances have made it possible for me to leave today to keep to my original intention though certain intruding factors such as completely unqualified persons looking for a replacement for me while i was in office have hastened the processall the positions we hold are like costumes of a dance once the dance is finished the dancers remove their costumes and wear the new costume for the new dance i remove my costume happily while the happy laughter of those who are happier than i for that echo in the back ground but remember the one who laughs last laughs best i don t know who will have the last laugh i am matured enough to have successfully forgiven persons who during my long tenure planned executed and manipulated to cut grass under my feet and slung mud at me my mind is not a dustbin to keep anger and hatred i consider it as a treasure box to keep love happiness and sweet memories i think all of you will endorse that i did not keep anger hatred and was not jealous of anyone i always strived to treat you with love and respect without exception and reservation to keep happiness intacttrue power lies in your ability to give it upsome may wonder with only several months left to the end of the first term of presidency why i have not simply managed and hanged on to this powerful position but as there is a fair amount of young people with long careers ahead of them gathered here today let me humbly share with you a word of wisdom there is no inherent power in power if there were an inherent power in power you can t oust those with power the true power of power whether it is personal professional or political comes with your ability to give up that power the strength that renouncement of power gives you is unmatched by any other force the buddha taught us this lesson years ago it is something important that public servants and politicians alike should reflect on there nothing no person no position no comfort no luxury no hope that i cannot give up i know very well what it is to suffer i also know well what comfort is if i saw something beautiful i have directly appreciated it this is well known by those who associate me closely i have associated kings and paupers i have wept at the sight of mass murders at aranthalawa aluth oya or fort bus station i have sung and danced in happy times even today it is like that tomorrow i will be the same but i prefer the smell of sweat of the poor in a camp in kilinochchi or sampur than the smell of perfume in colombo or paris this has been conditioned by my experiences in public service therefore today i can leave public service and lead a normal life i gratefully remember who paved the way to what i am today my parents teachers religious personalities who advised me colleagues in public and private sectors political heads who gave a helping hand in many ways whenever i needed their strength friends who have given me unconditional love cracked a jokes lessened my pain in hard times i thank my family especially my wife who bore my semipublic life reluctantly with enormous grace silence and great patience i thank my emotionally resilient and persevering children who have shared the ups and downs of my journey with philosophical jocularity i thank my innocent grandchildren who missed my personal attention on them this is their time hand on my heartfor the last three years i stayed away from writing there is so much in my mind that used to produce at least two good quality sinhala and english articles per month i could not write these things because of the bonds of public service after today i m free from that bondage it gives me new hope that now i can write and speak on public service and politics from today onwards especially i believe i should share my views on the spheres of politics society and reconciliation i have kept my lessons learnt in public service in my heart to be shared by anyone who needs them i hope to publish at least a drop of it one day before i die and if i am to do so i must have respite the designation of president s secretary is not suitable towards that end i was able to type pages of my memoirs before june since june i have only types pages now i can start again i will also start writing about the last year very soon therefore i extend my profound thanks and gratitude to all who hastened my departure i am respectfully grateful to themrecently at a meeting here in the secretariat a person sated that if you keep your ear to the earth what you will hear will shake our hearts at that moment i thought that its easier to keep your hand on the heart than to keep the ear to earth if you keep your hand to your heart you can hear an echo full of truth whether i keep my ear to the earth or my hand to my heart i m sure i will not hear any echo that shall shake my heart i can be happy about that lalith weeratunga you are entwined to our liveshowever echo orno echo there was one sight at the twilight of my public service that shook me that was connected to my friend lalith weeratunga as most of you know him personally what i m about to say will forever entwined in the lives of most of us and i must say it because almost all of you are younger than i and this advice will serve you well in your future following the verdict of the sil redi issue you may have seen him being escorted to welikada prison he was walking with a brave face but helpless most certainly with the crushed spirit with all due respect to the judiciary i still wonder if it is he who should have been sent to prison those who ordered him and the fake handers on were not to be seen on that day the only person who was with him was my long standing dear friend his wife indrani whether it is public service or service of the people for an unjust or unfortunate reason when we are depressed remember only our spouses and children will be there for us till the end this is a reality you must internalize and repeat like a mantra it should be your daily mantra you were all my childreni say good bye to you completing over fifty years in public service wishing you all the best in your personal and professional lives i don t think i will be a public servant ever again it is for tomorrow to see my heart and my home are both open for your joys success and sadness i will say the following words for you to etch them in your hearts the greatest inheritance you can leave your children is your honesty lawfulness respect for and humanity there is no jewel more precious that true respect for humanity and true love for humanity protect that jewel forsaking your life as governor of the eastern province and as president s secretary for the last three and a half years you have won my special appreciation as officers and colleagues some were my friends you all were my brother and sisters and daughters and sons to mei no longer pat his back but my affection is unchangedit would be a great oversight if i don t speak a few words about his excellency the president i have known him for the last years when he was a young man full of personality all these years till today we have had deep mutual love affection friendship trust and personal bond on th november at his wijerama residence he confided in me that he was going to make a dangerous political leap i explained to him the dangerous repercussions that can befall on himself and his family and asked him if he was willing to face them he said yes then i patted him on the back and said in that case i will take this path with you i still remember when i said that his eyes shined and he smiled since his excellency is now the president i no longer pat his back but my affection for him is unchanged even by an iota therefore i always extended to him the same mutual love affection friendship trust and commitment as on that that day with time with his rise to the pinnacle of political life our relationship evolved accordingly new associated materialize and the priorities of a head of state also change therefore if i could not adjust to politics because my core is the service of the state and if it inconvenienced him i apologize for that when an older person errs many times the younger person has to forgive and forget i hope he extends the same courtesy to me i must also make special mention on mrs jayanthi sirisena whom i know for long years during my tenure as governor or president secretary she never once made a single request for any special privilege or comfort she is a great example of separating family life from political life i say this with the greatest confidence she is a guiding light to political authority i wish the best of joy health and prosperity to the president first lady and their children your honour is the greatest inheritance for your childrenunfortunately or unintentionally if i have been harsh to anyone of you please forgive me if i have hurt your heart forgive me none of that has been intentional but situational you meet me on the road in future talk to me ask me how i am and smile with me i only expect that friendship from you if anyone of you made a mistake i have taken full responsibility for it and shielded you from the president or any other official this is because i considered you to be my children without my support you would have been orphaned i hope my successor will protect you the same way i also hope that the president my longtime friends presidential advisors wjs karunarathne dr sarath rajapathirana thilak ranaviraja the officials of the secretariat personal staff of the president led by eric weerawardhana and the family of the president will all support the new presidents secretary as they have supported me always remember there is no greater jewel than your untainted honor and it is the greatest inheritance you can leave your children thank you all very much may the noble triple gem bless you may god bless you may you have health good luck happiness and prosperity in abundancefarewell

july lbo in a recent speech in parliament the jo s leading economic voice hon tharaka balasuriya mp offered significant constructive criticism on the national audit bill the bill puts forward an independent audit commission that will have significant authority much like other independent commissions in sri lanka such as police judicial etc balasuriya is happy about the legislation but unhappy about important provisions that he feels have been omittedsome of balasuriya s suggestions for improvement of the bill are put forward belowprevent politicisation of independent commissions with garden period balasuriya suggests a garden period which aims to prevent public officials from excising their responsibilities in order to enhance immediate future personal gain or political prospects a garden period will essentially prevent the heads and members of independent commission high ranking members of the armed forces and even the police whereby high ranking officers cannot engage in political activity or seek public office even after retirement for a given period time this will essentially prevent high ranking officers who have fiduciary rights from excising their influence whilst in office for personal gain after retirement prearranged dates for announcements and proclamations of independent commissions the jo mp was also critical of remarks made by the auditor general before the last local government election he suggests legislation should be in place where these announcements can not be made to coincide with elections take the case of the present auditor general who went on air just before a crucial election which had been postponed by years and decided to given his opinion about book keeping during the last government my contention is not the validity of the statement irrespective of the statement s validity what needs to be assessed is whether the auditor general s statement has an influence or not on the general public and if there is an influence then such statement at such times should be forbidden by law financial independence of ag departmentthe auditor general s department which falls under the ministry of public administration is continuously pleading his case for more resources and manpower in this regard balasuriya claims the bill falls short of the intention of making the auditor general s department more independent this is because the bill fails to provide financial independence from the treasury and fails to provide independence from the ministry of public administration for manpower requirements balasuriya said that a parliamentary select committee should oversee and directly debit the consolidated fund for the financial requirement of the audit commissionaudits of institutions with government shareholding i would also like to see provisions included in this bill which will enable not only government subsidiaries with shareholding been audited but also associate companies with over at least or for that matter any institution with government holding where financial abuse seems to take place

jul lbo transparency international sri lanka tisl has released a legislative brief on the national audit bill detailing key amendments to be made in committee stagethe brief is being released ahead of a debate on the bill in parliament thursdayit highlights four key areas of concern with the provisions of the existing draft of the national audit billthese concerns surround the lack of accountability in the surcharging procedure weaknesses in the appeals process provisions which curtail the investigative powers of the auditor general and provisions which are in contravention of the right to information acttisl strongly believes that if these amendments are incorporated in the final act this will significantly strengthen fiscal accountability in the public sector the key concerns mentioned in the brief follows wwwtisrilankaorg surcharging power is exercised by the chief accounting officer when the audit service commission reports the deficiency or losssurcharging power is assigned to chief accounting officers section a as per the interpretation section of the gazette bill chief accounting officers includes the secretary to a ministry officer in charge of a department specified under article of the constitution or an officer in charge of any other department not supervised by a secretary section it is commendable that the auditor general was not appointed as the surcharging authority since he is the body that conducts the audit findings of which ultimately become the basis of the surcharge certificate the best option would have been to establish an independent surcharging authority under the gazetted bill however as evident from the gazetted bill such a policy has not been recognized as the governing policythe current provisions that empower the chief accounting officers to surcharge highlight a potential conflict of interest and could be a roadblock in recovering money that has been lost to a state entityb the chief accounting officer is not expected to specify reasons or the basis for not surcharging or amending altering or varying the amounts specified by the audit service commission the provisions in the gazetted bill makes it mandatory for the chief accounting officer to impose the surcharge specified by the audit service commission section however he is mandated to offer each person in respect of whom the surcharge is to be imposed an opportunity to make representations section a the chief accounting officer must consider these representations when making a decision on the surcharge section b when the surcharge is imposed the chief accounting officer needs to give reasons section e i after considering the representations if the surcharge is not imposed or if the amount is amended altered or varied there is no express provision necessitating the chief accounting officer to record reasons and provide a basis to the audit service commission since the decision to surcharge can have a significant impact on the finances of the auditee entity the chief accounting officer must be expressly required to record reasons and the basis for not surcharging amending altering or varying the amount duerefer heading e below for recommended wording c when the surcharge is collected defaulted or when an appeal is pending the chief accounting officer is not expected to notify the audit service commission in the event that the surcharge is defaulted it is the audit service commission that initiates recovery proceedings as per section therefore in order for the audit service commission to correctly identify the defaulted surcharges it is crucial that the chief accounting officer notifies the audit service commission of the status of collections andor defaults the chief accounting officer must notify the audit service commission when the surcharge is defaulted or when an appeal is pending refer heading f g below for recommended wording appeal procedure is incomplete a the president imposes the surcharge on a chief accounting officer who is responsible for causing the deficiency or loss the gazetted bill is silent on the appeal procedure for the chief accounting officerthe gazetted bill has a lacuna with regard to the appeal procedure available to an affected chief accounting officer further empowering the president to impose the surcharge on a chief accounting officer would limit his ability to challenge such decision in the same manner as would any other affected person under the gazetted bill because of the unique protections afforded to the decisions of the president where the person responsible for the loss or deficiency is the chief accounting officer the audit service commission must impose the surcharge in such instances the auditor general being the chairman of the audit service commission as per article a of the constitution must recuse himself the appeal process set up under the gazetted bill must be available to chief accounting officers the audit service commission must pursue the procedures relating to surcharge and appeal as specified under part iv of the gazetted bill refer heading j k l below for recommended wordingb there is no explicit provision for the audit service commission to appeal against a decision of the chief accounting officer to the surcharge appeal committee or thereafter to the court of appeal whilst any person affected by the decision of the chief accounting officer or the surcharge appeal committee can appeal the gazetted bill does not expressly specify that the audit service commission is able to initiate an appeal the phrase any person is not defined in the gazetted bill this is an important power that the audit service commission must have in light of the chief accounting officers discretion to amend vary or alter the surcharge furthermore it is essential to provide such an appeal mechanism in the interests of public finance management it is recommended that any person under section is expressly defined to include the audit service commissionc the surcharge appeal committee can allow disallow an appeal or amend alter or vary the decision of the chief accounting officer there is no provision to specify reasons or the basis for the decision to ensure impartiality it is essential that the surcharge appeal committee record reasons and the basis for their decision refer heading h below for recommended wording auditor general s power of investigation is curtaileda the person called to appear before the auditor general can nominate another to appear on his behalf the auditor general has the authority to call persons for the purpose of obtaining information and documents section b any person who is requested to appear before the auditor general may nominate a person to appear on their behalf if unable to comply with the request due to unavoidable circumstances section this could be misused by persons who would not like to share information and will undermine the auditor general s power to collect necessary information this provision is contrary to the lima principles that recognizes the necessity for a supreme audit institution to have comprehensive investigative powers section of the lima principles the summoned person must appear before the auditor general in person therefore section must be deleted or alternatively if a person is nominated the auditor general must concur with thisappointmentrefer heading a below for recommended wording b failure to appear before the auditor general is not an offence there is a conflict between the english and sinhala versions of the bill in the sinhala version it is an offence to refuse to appear before the auditor general when requested to do so but it is not an offence if a person fails to respond to such a request in the english version both failing and refusing to appear are not offences these contradictory provisions would lead to unnecessary confusions at interpretations and could undermine the power of the auditor general to obtain important information related to the audit accordingly failure or refusal to appear before the auditor general and failure or refusal to nominate a person conversant on the subject with the concurrence of the auditor general depending on whether the provision to nominate is retained or not when requested to do so must be made offences refer heading p below for recommended wording the right to information is curtailedthe gazetted bill proposes to create a separate nondisclosure regime that restricts the right to information the regime created by article a of the constitution and the rti act must not be derogated from by way of subsequent legislation a it is an offence for the members of the audit service commission or any person appointed to any office under the act to disclose any information received by him in the performance of his duties section forms a separate bar to the disclosure of information which is not covered under article a of the constitution or section of the rti act that details the instances that disclosure of information can be limited this violates the right to information and therefore needs to be deleted b information cannot be disclosed until consent is obtained by the relevant person and the report or statement containing such information is presented in parliamentthe only permissible exceptions to rti are listed in article a of the constitution given effect to by section of the rti act section b imposes an additional condition of not disclosing information until the auditor general s report has been presented in parliament the rti law contains no provision to cover such an instancetherefore section needs to be deleted c oath of secrecy in schedule to section c continues the obligation to abide by the secrecy provision in relation to information relating to the reports which are presented in parliament the oath states the following the obligations herein set out shall bind me during my term of office in the and shall continue thereafter except in relation to any information that has come into public domain due to no breach of my obligations hereunder accordingly the oath only lapses in relation to the report or statement prepared by the auditor general relating to such information has been presented in parliament the information relating to the report would be covered by the oath because the conditions in section b would still have to be met to be a permissible disclosure as per the oath to comply with any written law c in the oath when specified under any written law subject to section b of the national audit act no of which is the rti act in this instant this in effect means that the information beyond the report or statement remains outside of the ambit of the rti act permanantly section of the gazetted bill goes so far as to make it an offence to communicate such information

needed from a broad spectrum through various sources covering all the economic activities of the country for instance in each quarter administrative data are collected from about organizations apart from that data are also collected through censuses surveys administrative reports annual reports research reports etc however there are instances where the required data are not available at the time of releasing national accounts estimates for certain economic activities it takes a year or more to obtain finalized data required for calculation of national account estimatesfor example there are two paddy cultivation seasons in our country maha and yala harvesting of maha and yala seasons are taken place from february to april and august to september respectively however sowing periods of maha and yala spans from september to march and april to august respectively the value added of rice growing is estimated and are used in respective quarters in gdp estimates as final production statistics are not available for respective quarters final real outputproduction data will only be available when the harvesting is over in the entire country then only final quarterly and annual value added of rice growing subeconomic activity can be calculated in respective quartersaccordingly provisional data are used for some economic activities in compiling national account estimates therefore the national accounts estimates already released need to be updatedrevised for no reasons other than the final data becoming available if not revised the true scenario of the economy may not be captured correctlyrevising gdp estimates is an internationally recommended practice and it is being practiced in many countries national accounts estimates cannot be analyzed in the future if final national account estimates are calculated and recorded when the final data become availablerevision policyas per international national accounts guidelines and like many other national accounts compiling countries dcs introduced a revision policy for sri lanka during the last rebasing exercise and was published in the second quarter of according to this published revision policy national account estimates issued for a particular quarteryear can be continued to be revised as explained belowaccording to the revision policy of national account estimates provisional estimates are prepared and published days after the respective quarter these estimates are based on quick estimates provisional data obtained from different sources similarly in days after completing a year annual estimates and the th quarter estimates are released with the revised estimates for the first three quarters of the same year and for previous two years these estimates are known as revised provisional estimates after receiving the final data for the year final quarterly and annual national accounts estimates are released all the revisions are published in the revision triangle under the national accounts section of dcs websitemany countries that prepare national account estimates in a proper manner uses a revision policy for compilation and publishing of national account estimates for example according to the national accounts revision policy of united states of americausa provisions are there to revise the gdp estimates even up to twenty times per each quarteryear usa and great britain and almost all other european countries follow similar revision policiesrevision of gdp and updating growth ratein general the economic growth rate is the rate at which a nation s gdp changesgrows from one year to another similarly economic growth rate of quarter is calculated as the percentage change of the real gdp of a quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year therefore it is clear that revision of gdp of a quarter or a year lead to updating the corresponding growth ratesfor an example the published provisional estimate of real gdp of first quarter of the year was rs mn as per the revision policy by now it has been revised four times estimated gdp of the first quarter at the first second third and fourth revisions were rs mn rs mn rs mn and rs mn respectively these revisions were done on and respectively according to these revisions of gdp growth rate of the first quarter were revised as respectively on the above dates the gdp of first quarter were also revised several times for reasons explained abovethe latest estimated growth rate for first quarter of released on was estimated at as the percentage change from most recent gdp estimates of the first quarter of rs mn to rs mn that of first quarter in calculating growth rates most recent estimates of real gdp of both years should be used and not revised values of previous roundscompiling estimates using data from two base year periodsno national accounts estimate can be compiled using data under the base year and data coming under the previous base year periods together the main reason for this is that during the last base year revision parallel to moving base year from to number of improvements for national account compilation process was introduced those improvements include methodological changes coverage expansion of production boundary adaptation latest classifications and sna gdp deflatorby complying with internationally recommended procedures gdp is calculated at nominal current and real constant prices after compilation of gdp number of macroeconomic indicators are prepared one of the very important such indicators is the gdp implicit price deflator which is a measure of the level of prices of all new domestically produced final goods and services in an economy the gdp implicit price deflator considers all the economic activities of the entire economy and it serves the purpose of measuring inflation of the country this is one of the indicator used to measure the changes in the price levels of finished goods services at a particular period of timethe gdp deflator is calculated by dividing nominal current gdp by real constant gdp accordingly gdp deflator is compiled after compiling gdp but not the other way aroundimpact of revision of gdp on gdp deflatorobviously as the gdp is revised as per revision policy of national accounts gdp implicit price deflator too get revised since gdp deflator is the rate calculated by dividing nominal gdp by real gdp therefore gdp implicit price deflator is a byproduct of national accounts compilation process before compiling the gdp deflator thousands of calculations need to be done in a number of work sheets to compile gdp estimates therefore it is almost impossible to carry out backward calculations to obtain gdp with predecided gdp deflators and it is not an internationally accepted practice of estimating national accounts statisticspublishing national accounts estimatesall national account estimates compiled by the dcs including all revisions are published in the dcs website wwwstatisticsgovlk these numbers are quoted and published by some other institutions in their certain publications however estimates published in their publications may not necessarily be the most recent revisions therefore it is recommended to use dcs website to obtain the most recent statisticscolombo consumer price index ccpithe consumer price index cpi is an indicator that measures the weighted average of market prices of a selected basket of consumer goods and services the ccpi is calculated and published monthly by the dcs on the last working day of the month it is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them market prices not provisional prices of these goods and services are collected from selected markets in the urban areas of colombo district to calculate the ccpi through a price survey therefore there is no need at all to revise the published colombo consumer price index as the prices used were actual prices contrary to this gdp estimates need to be revised as the value added of certain sub economic activities are estimated using provisional data

technology center in colombo since it was initially envisaged as an informal platform that would allow them to challenge likeminded colleagues in friendly bouts of gaming while exchanging views on the subjectramesh maddegoda architect technology at virtusa was among the small group which founded the virtusa gdsig at that time video gaming was not a popular idea in the sri lankan corporate world so ramesh and the team had to come up with creative ways to promote the positive aspects of video game development and drive this initiative our shared passion for gaming brought us together says ramesh in our discussions we identified that there was an opportunity for sri lanka to tap into the game development industry the soaring revenues generated by the big names in gaming with some titles grossing as much as hollywood blockbusters caught our attention armed with basic game development skills we sought to bring some of this work to sri lankan shores he reminiscesthe starryeyed team got

july lbo sri lanka s expresident mahinda rajapaksa says no contribution was made by china harbour company to his presidential election campaignreleasing a statement rajapaksa said if any election campaign contributions had been made to him by china harbour company the port city contract would not have been restored to them and neither would they have been allowed to bid for the lease of the hambantota harbourhe added that the main allegation that million dollars had been given to him as campaign contributions by china harbor company during the presidential elections is based on a reuters report that appeared three years agofull statement is reproduced belowallegations made by the new york timesthe new york times published an article titled how china got sri lanka to cough up a port on monday june and our political opponents have made quite a carnival of it marching to the fcid to make complaints holding press conferences and calling for presidential commissions of inquiry however the main allegation in this article that million usd had been given to me as campaign contributions by china harbor co during the presidential elections is based on a reuters report that appeared three years ago in july at that time the new yahapalana government had suspended all chinese funded projects and all chinese firms including china harbour co which was building the colombo port city were being investigated more than a year later this government cleared china harbour co of any wrongdoing and the port city project was handed back to themno contribution was made by china harbour co to my presidential election campaign while claiming that my affiliates and campaign aides had got the money and that volunteers had delivered the cheques to temple trees the writer of the new york times article has been intentionally vague about who had given this money and who had received it this seems to be a way of carrying out a smear campaign without incurring any liability the prime minister himself has gone on record describing the colombo port city as the premier project on which his government has placed its hopes if any election campaign contributions had been made to me by china harbour co the port city contract would not have been restored to them and neither would they have been allowed to bid for the lease of the hambantota harbour the nyt writer has stated that they had obtained some of the details in that article from a sri lankan government investigation every sri lankan knows that the main preoccupation of this government since it came into power has been to sling mud at the oppositionthe nyt writer alleged that china financed the hambantota port project with the ulterior motive of ensnaring sri lanka in a debt trap even though the feasibility studies said the port wouldn t work that is not true one of the world s foremost engineering consultancy firms ramboll of denmark was identified by the chandrika kumaratunga government to do the first feasibility study but that government was defeated before the study could get off the ground then the ranil wickremasinghe government commissioned another top engineering consultancy firm snc lavalin of canada which completed its feasibility study in june in under the second chandrika kumaratunga government minister mangala samaraweera commissioned ramboll of denmark again to do a feasibility study and this was completed in thus two feasibility studies under two different governments recommended the building of the hambantota portthe loans taken to build phases i ii and the bunkering facility of the hambantota harbor amounted to around million usd the nyt writer alleged that the initial loan of million had been renegotiated to a fixed rate after having been taken initially at a concessionary rate the intention was to make the point that china was lending at exorbitant rates of interest this initial loan was taken at the libor benchmark rate plus during that period the libor london interbank offered rate increased pushing up the actual interest rate of the initial loan to it was then that a fixed rate of was negotiated however the remaining usd one billion was taken from china at the concessionary interest rate of the writer states that loans could have been taken from other countries at an even lower rate of interest however in taking project loans the interest rate is not the only criteria to be considered when such bilateral agreements are entered into the lending nation recommends the contractor and the price quoted by this contractor also has to be taken into account in that respect china provided the best deal the hambantota port was actually built at a lower cost than the estimates in the ramboll and snc lavalin feasibility reportsthe hambantota port is deemed to have failed because it drew only ships in compared with ships at the colombo port however the nyt writer fails to mention that this increased to in the port made an operating profit of rs million in and rs million in these are investments that last centuries and a new harbour that opened in cannot be expected to produce profits by the writer further claims that the present government was compelled to lease the port to china because they were unable to repay the loan taken to build it the total cost of financing the hambantota port capital plus interest will be usd million by the time the loan expires in by the end of nearly usd million of this total amount had already been repaid there was never any problem about meeting the payments for the hambantota port because it was paid out of the profits of the sri lanka ports authority slpa the auditor general s report for states that the profit of the slpa in after paying all loans and taxes was rs billioneven though the nty writer appears to be unaware of it every sri lankan knows that the government did not use the million usd received from the port lease to repay the loan taken to build it instead it went to the treasury to meet the day to day expenditure of the government and the loan still remains on our books though the writer claims that china has got the hambantota harbor with its industrial zone of acres and an additional acres from sri lanka due to the debt trap that china inveigled sri lanka into there was never any chinese debt trap as alleged the slpa had made careful plans to raise the money to meet the loan repayments until the hambantota port broke even this included the development of the colombo east container terminal which was expected to bring in an additional income of million usd a year to the slpawhen my government was voted out we had already signed a supply operate and transfer contract with china harbour co and china merchant co to operate the hambantota container terminal for years the other terminals and the acre industrial zone in the harbor was to be controlled by the slpa we never had any plans to lease the entire free port for years to any foreign company that took place under the present government which was installed in power by the very western nations that are now complaining about the chinese presence in hambantota when i was president china never asked for the port on lease or for any land outside the port it is the present government of sri lanka that proposed to china that they take the entire free port on leasethe nyt writer states that the lease of the hambantota port gave china control of territory close to the shores of india and that india was now apprehensive about the uses that this port may be put to such a situation would never have arisen if my government had continued in power former indian external affairs secretary and national security advisor shivshankar mennon has said in his book choices inside the making of india s foreign policy that my defense secretary gotabaya rajapaksa had a clear view of sri lanka s interests which was completely compatible with india s interests and that india had been given assurances about the nature of sri lanka s relationship with china mennon further stated that gotabaya was sensitive to india s concerns and that the assurances given to india by my government were respected throughout the duration of the congress party government which was voted out in may the new york times has described me as china s preferred partner in sri lanka given what has taken place after i have no doubt that i am now the preferred partner of india as wellmahinda rajapaksa former president of sri lanka 
july lbo sri lanka s general treasury says former central bank governor ajith nivard cabraal has tried to present a different and distorted viewpoint on the central government s financial statement in an article published recently under the caption the government s growth scam the full statement issued by finance ministry is reproduced belowgeneral treasury puts the record straight on central government s outstanding debtthe attention of the general treasury has been drawn to an article published in the recent days under the caption the government s growth scam by mr ajith nivard cabraal a former governor central bank of sri lanka where he has tried to present a different and distorted viewpoint on the central government s financial statementin this article mr cabraal claims that there is some discrepancy in published statistics on gross domestic product gdp and government s debt to gdp ratio while leaving for the relevant institution to clarify on the matters relating to compilation of gdp statistics the general treasury would like to place the following on record on the outstanding debt to gdp ratio of the governmentthe writer in his article had mentioned three debt to gdp ratios to be applicable as at end of while arriving subjectively at his own gdp value as rs billion whereas the official figure is rs billiontable differences in debt to gdp ratios mentioned in the aforesaid newspaper articleas shown in the table above the officially published ratio of debt to gdp in is percent mr ajith nivard cabraal for reason best known to him has endeavourd to manipulate this official figure of the debt to gdp ratio as percentas per the decisions taken by the then cabinet of ministers during the period from to the loan obtained by certain state own enterprises soes were not included in the government s financial statements accordingly the previous government had transferred the loan balances of hambantota port project mattala airport ceylon electricity board and the airport and aviation services authority from the central government s financial statement on the assumption that these debts could be repaid by the respective soes it is pity that mr cabraal as the then governor of the central bank who was privy to this decision is now trying to manipulate the debt to gdp ratio by citing the public policy of noninclusion of debt held by soes in the government s balance sheet this was a decision taken by the then government in which he was a prominent stakeholder in handling the government s debt managementthe general treasury has nothing to hide about the debt to gdp ratio or the highest debt liabilities to be meted out in and the government is on record to make the highest debt servicing of rs trillion in of which a substantial portion is to meet the maturity of loans obtained prior to changing of gdp estimates by the author concerned based on his own assumptions and then reporting a different debtgdp ratio is of no significance to the general treasury because the general treasury relies on the independent gdp compiling authority namely department of census and statistics when it comes to computing ratios of government statistics visavis gdp hence the socalled debtgdp ratio of percent as reported in the newspaper article is a hypothetical figure for which the general treasury would not need to comment onhowever the general treasury would like to explain the difference between officially published government debt of rs bn at end and auditor general s calculations of rs bn which led to the increase of debtgdp ratio from percent to percent as at end it is important to note at the outset that such difference is entirely due to classification differences of certain debt obligations as reported in government s accounts and auditor general s report such classification differences are explained belowa majority of such classification difference is due to the transfer of debt liability relating to eight loan agreements from the central government to the respective stateownedenterprises soes by cabinet decisions taken during and according to auditor general s report on government accounts for the debt balance of rs million remained as at december relating to loan agreements entered into by the government under the contractual agreements had not been included in these financial statementsthe remaining difference between officially published outstanding debt balance of rs bn and auditor general s calculations of rs bn as at end is mainly due to exclusion of treasury bonds issued to two stateownedenterprises namely ceylon petroleum corporation cpc and sri lankan airlines for settling dues as reported in the annual report of central bank of sri lanka for statistical appendix table the outstanding debt balance of rs bn excludes treasury bonds issued to cpc in january to settle dues and to sri lankan airlines in march for capitalization purposes which in total amounts to an outstanding balance of rs bn as at end of any remaining marginal difference if exists can be attributable to the net credit to government from banking sector operationsthus the classification differences in government debt statistics as highlighted date back to debt management measures implemented during through this has caused confusion among the general public hence corrective measures would be taken in due course nonetheless any attempt to discredit the official statistics on government debt at present deems to call into question the debt management measures taken then while serving no any other purpose in the interest of the economythe current government is determined to consolidate the outstanding government debt over the mediumterm supported by a credible fiscal consolidation framework the envisaged path for primary surplus and current account surplus in fiscal operations would ensure a steady fall in debtgdp ratio in the coming years having recognized the government s fiscal consolidation plan the international organizations such as international monetary fund imf and world bank project a lower debtgdp ratio for sri lanka over the mediumterm for instance imf staff report on sri lanka published in june projects sri lanka s debtgdp ratio at percent by sourcehttpswwwimforgenpublicationscrissues srilanka articleivconsultationandthefourthreviewundertheextendedarrangement such projections would necessarily inform the international rating agencies in their review of sri lanka s debt sustainability and overall economic stability over the mediumterm

by jekhan aruliahaccording to the sri lanka tourist development authority s sltda map of tourist attractions at the time of writing this post the only attraction in the northern province is the airport in jaffnai suppose we should be grateful the map at least has the airport the sltda map shows the rest of the northern province as a total barren wasteland perhaps their intention in showing the jaffna airport is to reassure tourists there s a quick way to escape the north when the boredom sets inthis desolate representation of the north is both unfair and fair the northern province is a place where one could with some justification say the journeys are greater than the destinations i have done the trip to nainativunagadeepa several times accompanying visiting friends the drive across the causeways through the islands and then onto the boat at the kurikadduwan jetty is in my opinion a greater tourist experience than the nainativu temples themselves the scenery the sea and the birdlife along the journey are worth the trip even if you turn around at the jetty without crossing the water to nainativu as it takes nearly an hour each way to drive from jaffna town and the boat trip costs virtually nothing it would be silly not to take to the water squeezing in with or so other people down in the hull of an old ramshackled boat powered by what looks like an aging lawnmower motor is certainly worth doing at least twice there and backthe drive from where i live in jaffna town to poonakary or to iyakachchi or to killinochchi and mullaitivu are all wonderful vast areas of land changing from town and village to forest to paddy fields to kulam and coastlines to coconuts and palmyrah wonderful journeys to destinations that have very little to offer to a roaming touristfor me the destinations make it worth my while taking those trips as i have friends who serve a good lunch and know where to get a decent bottle of toddybut if i was just a roaming tourist after that wonderful journey i would be left to console myself at a roadside boutique with little more than vaddai and sweet teaeven those treasures that do exist are not valued by we who should value them king sangiliyan s minister s house an impressive old edifice around the corner from the nallur temple is guarded by nothing more than an unlocked rusty gate and a few stray dogs with its ample grounds you might expect a nice caf or restaurant and perhaps some historical entertainments a museum or a theatre in practice you will only meet other humans there if they came with you the only literature available is the copious new graffiti on the ancient walls professions of love and proof of poor securityin the magnificent jaffna fort nothing is done except for a small sleepy poorly stocked souvenir shop a shop staffed by bored young people selling dusty old books and statues more often about southern sri lanka than about jaffna and the northif you want a snack in the jaffna fort you can t have one unless you bring it yourself in a bag either you buy something from the ice cream vans in the parking area outside or you wait until you get back to your guesthousei have walked on beautiful beaches in mullaitivu point pedro karainagar and velanai with no one in sight other than those who make a living fishing on vellanai island s famous chaddycharty beach you will find a few unattended beach huts and a kade selling soda pop and biscuits a midrange jaffna hotel does have a branch at chaddycharty beach but the demand there isn t enough to maintain a proper kitchen when i have every now and then joined a group there for an excellent lunch we placed the order a day or more beforehand and the hotel sent a van with the food from their main jaffna propertyquite apart from all the thousands of acres of wide open spaces and the thousands of square feet of historic and cultural monuments it s amazing the revenue generating potential of one square meter of beach towel they understand this in the south where foreign pleasure seekers soak up a tan while buying costly cocktails and canapes there are few better sales opportunities than cash rich foreigners trying to stave off the boredom of browning themselves lying flat on their backs and then browning themselves lying flat on their frontstourists don t just tour from one place to another taking photographs and sunning themselves they spend a lot of time searching for places to spend their money eating drinking and shopping when i first moved to jaffna in late i would wander around optimistically looking for places to eat to my shame despite being a pure bred jaffna tamil i don t speak any tamil nor any sinhala for that matter my inability to communicate resulted in my first and last meal at a highly recommended vegetarian restaurant on powerhouse road in the centre of jaffna town being an unsatisfying limp dosai full of lightly cooked onions the waiter misunderstood what i asked for i was incapable of conveying my disappointment so i just ate what was delivered and have never been back since buying souvenirs and gifts is a struggle even after more than two years in jaffna i don t know a good place to buy gifts before heading to colombo or london let alone to recommend to visitors seeking to spend their money on mementosfor those who would say i am not looking hard enough an effective tourist industry needs to make it easy for weary travellers weighed down by their cash to find these places and those who know me will confirm i walk around the place a lot looking for interesting things so it is not for want of searchingi can be blamed for not speaking tamil but a tourist can t i have failed to spend thousands of rupees because i couldn t explain to the vendor what i wanted or i couldn t find the vendor at all like this millions more rupees stay in tourist pockets that should be spent buying northern goods and services the decades long civil war robbed the north of many things not least its once strong facility with the english languagein i went to the hospital to get anti rabies injections following an unfortunate incident with a stray dog during one of my regular evening walks i must say at this point in defence of jaffna s mutts in over years of walking down the backstreets and by lanes of jaffna which themselves are beautiful and still scattered with dilapidated war damaged properties i have only been bitten once the person sitting at what seemed to be an enquiries desk in the hospital couldn t understand me leaving me to find my own way which i did with the help of other patients perhaps happy for a diversion from their patient waiting thankfully once i got to the relevant room the staff there spoke good english confirmed what had happened to me checked my tiny but bloodied wounds clearly explained the course of injections gave me my first set of jabs with little pain and generally treated me extremely wellthere are those who will leap to criticise the government for this in the words of the old proverb they would rather curse the darkness than light candles the government with support from india and china has provided good roads and a good railway line to the north while the government should do more we should have learned by now that it is in no hurry to do so investing in the north has not been the government s priority nor investing in the many poverty stricken regions of the south indrajit coomaraswamy the governor of the sri lanka central bank commented in april when you increase the poverty line to us which is less than rs earnings per day more than a quarter of the population in sri lanka falls below the poverty line with earnings just above us per day successive governments economic failures have been pretty indiscriminatethe ultimate responsibility for the continuing stagnation of the north lies with us tamils it is something the northern provincial council and the private sector must fix while there is a handful of brave tourism entrepreneurs investing in hotels from fancy to frugal this by itself is not enough a thriving tourist industry needs more than beds and bathrooms it needs multiple things to do sights to see varied venues to eat and drink areas to lounge places to shoptourism is part of but not all of the leisure industry the thriving restaurants and clubs of colombo have more locals using them than tourists in colombo there are many more locals using the sports facilities the cinemas and theatres the spas and the numerous shopping mallsa thriving leisure industry is vital for the recovery of the north not just to attract tourists the manufacturing and services industries have singularly failed to build a significant presence in the north since the end of the war having spent many years in the software industry i am aware that well paid professionals and their families look for leisure activities few would give up roles in glitzy colombo to move to austere jaffna not least for fear being nagged by bored spouses and children to bring high value jobs including manufacturing it financial services architects and engineers to the north there needs to be more to do here than just work and watch the sun come up and go downso what needs to be done i am no tourism expert but even the experts and consultants and ministries for all their purported assets and abilities have achieved little more than a trickle of tourists to the north therefore in spite of my lack of credentials i can t do worse than them so here goesit would be a major boost if the government opened up jaffna s palaly airport and kks harbour to provide direct access to foreign visitors not to mention a direct route to export northern products however in spite of indian financial and physical support and encouragement the sri lankan government has apparently gone for the footdragging option so let s not wait for this to happensome pioneering organisations have individually made the courageous leap of faith to invest in their own businesses examples of hotels in jaffna include jetwings the thinnai tilco valampuri and green grassmore pioneers who can bring together the funds and the skills also need to take a leap of faith pioneers who can create middle and upper market activities restaurants sports theatres theme parks venues that celebrate local culture and history activities staffed with at least some who speak the visitors languages english sinhala chinese german etc so when some foreigners in their foreign tongue ask for a trip to nainativu with a seafood lunch not too spicy on charty beach we can sell it to them when i visited the international organisation for migration s office in jaffna earlier this year they told me of hundreds of returning refugees in particular from france switzerland and australia presumably bringing french german italian and english language skills though jaffna peerpressure may discourage them from entering the leisure industry perhaps money and opportunity can persuade them otherwisethe pioneers need to do this on faith until the critical mass of attractions that draw in enough leisure seekers for other businesses to follow is achieved investing in jaffna at this time is a slow way to make money and can be a quick way to lose it so the pioneers need to have adequate financial reserves perhaps by putting together an investment fundi will finish this piece by stating another important reason why the north needs tourists professionals and diaspora to visit even now there is a perception that the north is an unusually dangerous place many people overseas and even in colombo still worry about the military stomping around or tamil criminal gangs waving swords or drunken dopedup rowdies on motorbikesas i wrote in an earlier article my personal experience in over two years living in jaffna as well as official data collected by the department of census and statistics shows that the north is one of the safer areas of sri lanka in terms of reported crime from burglary to kidnapping to murder it could be said that reported crime is artificially low in the north because the people don t trust the police but the same pattern is shown for drug arrests reported by the national dangerous drugs control board where the number of arrests and the rate of arrests per head of population is low compared to other provinces it s not likely the police are going super easy on the northern dopeheads so these figures are likely to be a fair representationthe more people come and witness and go back and testify to this the sooner the north will be normalised people need to become confident that visiting and living in the north is an attractive option to work and study and play only then will the north at last recover

june lbo former governor of the central bank of sri lanka ajith nivard cabral has recently released a statement on social media that is highly critical of the explosive new york times report which suggested chinese influence with regard to sri lanka s presidential electionthe statement is reproduced below the new york times article dated june titled how china got sri lanka to cough up a port written by maria abihabib is a gross misrepresentation of facts as well as a piece of journalism which has violated the truth in a shocking manner this is probably the type of propaganda under the veil of journalism that president donald trump has been regularly referring to as fake news or reportsi was interviewed by this nyt correspondent maria abi habib on th may and i countered almost every one of her string of allegations and preconceived notions in an hour long interview with irrefutable facts and figuresnot surprisingly maria abihabib has chosen to ignore all my responses relating to the chinese loans and projects as well as sri lanka s debt position under president mahinda rajapaksa which would have materially changed her flawed findings and highly suspect conclusions her stance therefore undoubtedly confirms she was on a mission to provide a predetermined and completely onesided view point which is detrimental to both china and sri lanka in general and presidents xi jingping and mahinda rajapaksa in particulari will submit a detailed reply to this shockingly imbalanced article which is not worthy of being published in a newspaper such as the new york times and expose it s subjectivity in a few days

by nishan fernandocorporate reportingbushman piotroski and smith identified that the availability of information was considered to be a key determinant of the efficiency of resource allocation decisions and growth in an economy availability of information is linked to corporate transparency defined as the widespread availability of firmspecific information to those stakeholders outside the firm corporate reporting plays a significant role in facilitating corporate transparencycorporate reporting involves periodic dissemination of firmspecific information this could be either voluntary or mandatory or a combination of both three broad aspects can be identified with regard to corporate reporting financial disclosures governance disclosures and the audit quality of these disclosures this article will address the financial disclosure aspect of transparency and considers its drivers the accounting principles used to recognize and measure financial disclosures and its timeliness together with the audit quality pertaining to financial disclosurestransparency and gaapfinancial statements have got the highest importance for any sort of business in fact one could say that the financial statement is the summary of the whole year s performance a financial statement is prepared in the transparent way as it s a source which will attract the investor and create desire among them for making an investment in that companytransparency in financial statements means that the statements should be userfriendly and clear and everything should properly be disclosed companies that understand the importance of transparency and financial reporting are also well informed about the psychology of the investors a complex and opaque financial report gives little understanding about the true risks involved and real fundamentals of the company one main concern while preparing the transparent financial statements therefore is that it should be interesting and easily understandable the use of hidden entries and complex accounting and financial terms should be minimised and both favourable and unfavourable sides should properly be elaboratedwhile making the financial statements transparent one also have to ensure whether they are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the sri lankan context gaap comprise the sri lanka financial reporting standards slfrs promulgated by the institute of chartered accountants of sri lanka ca sri lanka which are virtually the same as international financial reporting standards ifrs consequently compliance with slfrs makes the financial statements easily understandable internationallyagency problems and financial reportingresolving agency problems is integral to corporate governance and transparency two types of agency problems can be typically identified in the corporate world the first is that the interests of the board of directors and shareholders are aligned but the interests of management are not the second type is that the interests of the board and management are aligned with each other but their interests are not completely aligned with the interests of sharehold ersthese agency conflicts are reduced through both formal and informal measures formal measures include corporate charters employment contracts listing require ments and other regulations whereas many important governance functions are carried out via informal measuresaccording to research findings by verrecchia managers typically have better firmspecific information than nonexecutive directors and shareholders but they may not always truthfully report information that is detrimen tal to their personal interests such as information about poor performance or their consumption of private benefits boards which largely consist of nonexecutive directors and shareholders are therefore typically assumed to be at an infor mational disadvantage when monitoring managersthus one important role for financial reporting is to provide nonexecutive directors and shareholders with relevant and reliable infor mation to facilitate their mutual monitoring of management and in the case of shareholders their monitoring of directorsqualitative characteristics in financial reportingthe conceptual framework for slfrs identifies qualitative characteristics which enhance the usefulness in financial reporting to ensure high level of transparency in the above contextrelevance the need to disclose all material information and faithful representation the need to provide complete information which are neutral and free from error are considered fundamental to the quality of financial statementsthe conceptual framework further identifies four other characteristics which are considered to enhance the usefulness of financial information comparability ability to compare with the past information of the company and with the information of the other companies in the industry verifiability ability of different knowledgeable and independent observers to reach consensus timeliness provision of information at the right point in time to influence decision making understandability ability to understand information with reasonable effortindependent auditthe above characteristics will support the users to mitigate the agency conflicts thus increase the degree of transparency of the activities taking place in the company other than making the financial statement with proper elaborations and making it reader friendly it is necessary to ensure completeness of the transactions leading to each of the figures and they are truly recorded in making the financial statement transparent an independent audit will add value by improving the process as high level of auditing and cross checking ensures compliance with gaap and true and fair presentation of the financial statements the recent addition to the auditor s report requiring disclosure of key audit matters and mitigation of audit risks arising therefrom can be considered as another step forward to enhance transparency of financial reportingthe author is the managing director of bdo consulting pvt ltd and a past president of ca sri lanka

by alvin chenghin limon june the us and north korean leaders donald trump and kim jongun held a summiton sentosa island in singapore in which they committed to establishing a new relationship between their countries in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity and to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the korean peninsula to achieve this kim jongun committed to work toward complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula while some critics have noted that this was a broad statement of principles which set no deadline and left the path to disarmament undefined the sentosa agreement committed both governments to holding followon negotiations at the earliest possible date to implement the outcomes south korean president moon jaein who had himself met with kim jongun twice in the runup to the singapore summit has applauded the sentosa agreement describing it as a historic event that has helped break down the last remaining cold war legacy on earth the chinese government in the meantime has recommended the easing of international sanctions against north korea in order to support the current diplomatic dialogues and efforts in progressing towards denuclearization of the korean peninsula in addition chinese foreign minister wang yi noted today that the two countries highest leaders can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning and is creating a new history following his meeting with kim jongun trump announced that he intends to order an end to regular war games the united states conducts with ally south korea which have long been an irritant to north korea as he recognizes these as being very provocative and inappropriate given the optimistic opening he sees with north korea this announcement came as a surprise to the south korean government but moon jaein s office released a statement that they believe it is crucial to pursue various solutions for better dialogue beyond the sentosa agreement what could potentially be significant about kim jongun s visit to singapore is how it could mirror deng xiaoping s pivotal singapore visit kim s visit to singapore was not his debut on the international stage the runup to the singapore summit saw kim visiting china twice on highlychoreographed visits with chinese president xi jinping and also to the demilitarized zone between north and south korea for two brief but historic meetings with the south korean president but even so his trip to singapore was a major diplomatic event which received heavy coverage in the global news media and his evening of sightseeing the day before the summit was greeted with cheers of excitement from the curious public indeed the friendly reception from singaporeans was highlighted in the glowing frontpage report in the statecontrolled north korean rodong sinmun newspaper which included no fewer than images of his visit as observers noted this was unusual as media reports in north korea generally do not show detailed images of affluent foreign countries north korean leader kim jongun went on a surprise nighttime tour of singapore on june photo credit epaof special note in the north korean state media reports were the statements that kim jongun was impressed by singapore s economic development and hoped he could learn from the country that he found singapore clean and beautiful and that he had learned much about singapore s economic potential and how it had developed these statements echo similar sentiments made by china s late paramount leader deng xiaoping about singapore following deng s visit to singapore the chinese state media which had hitherto denounced singapore as a tool of western imperialism began instead to portray singapore as a garden city worth studying for its greening public housing and tourism the following year deng lauded the government of singapore for attracting foreign investment for the purpose of national development lee pp in deng xiaoping set a challenge to his government there is good social order in singapore they govern the place with discipline we should draw from their experience and do even better than them singapore s late prime minister lee kuan yew noted in his memoirs that following this challenge several hundred delegations came from china armed with tape recorders video cameras and notebooks to learn from our experience lee p in this important way singapore served as a model for deng s pivotal reform program which revolutionized china s economy as deborah brautigam notes at the start of the s china qualified as one of the world s twenty least developed countries the country s annual per capita income of placed it squarely between mozambique and burma p today china has the world s secondlargest economy and is expected in the coming decade to surpass the us as the world s largest economycould kim jongun be inspired to implement a similar economic reform program for north korea if he does singapore is wellprepared to help his government upgrade its human resources the singapore government s singapore cooperation programme scp has helped train over a hundred thousand officials from over countries including china in a range of over courses in fields including port management civil aviation and public governance as well as in emerging issues such as sustainable development cyber and food security and social governance the scp would be a key resource should kim jongun seek to modernize the north korean government and prepare it for the challenge of managing an open economy

a blog by tatiana nenovato facilitate foreign direct investment fdi sri lanka launched last week an innovative online onestop shop to help investors obtain all official approvals to mark the occasion this blog series explores different aspects of fdi in sri lanka part put forth reasons why sri lanka needs fdi part will relate how the world bank is helping to improve sri lanka s enabling environment for fdi sri lanka and foreign investmentsread a bit like a hit and miss storybut it was not always the casebefore companies like motorola and harris corporation had plans to establish plants in sri lanka s export processing zones others including marubeni sony sanyo bank of tokyo and chase manhattan bank had investments in sri lanka in the pipeline in the early sall this changed when the war convulsed the country and derailed its growth companies left and took their foreign direct investments fdi with themnearly a decade after the civil conflict ended in sri lanka is now in a very different placein foreign direct investment fdi into sri lanka grew to over billionincluding foreign loans receivedby companies registered with the boimore than doubling from the million achieved the previous yearbut sri lanka still has ways to go to attract more fdias a percentage of gdp fdi currently stands at a mere percent and lags behindmalaysia at percent and vietnam at percentmore importantly fdi into sri lanka has been skewed away from high valueadded global production networks and currently the larger share of fdi inflows have been focused on infrastructurewhile they may boost jobs and growth temporarily during the construction period these investments have little longterm impact compare this to a factory or a new it service firm which would employ people as long as it makes profit and export pay taxes and contribute to sri lanka s growth for decadesmoreover highinfrastructure fdi relies on few and large infrastructure deals that are unlikely to be replicatedand sustained over timeon the other hand manufacturing and services hold a better promise for the long run but even therea large share of fdi is related to traditional sectors and local marketoriented activities with low valueadded where productivity gains are smallto keep and increase fdi flows sri lanka will need to make concerted and ambitious efforts to address gaps and play to its strengthssimply put sri lanka can improve fdi by creating a more hospitable environment for investments taking steps in this direction is essential for domestic investment as well not only fdi and while the government has already begun targeting problem areas much more is neededto that end here are sixways sri lanka can improve fdireforms in sri lanka s trade policy saw eliminations or reductions of some paratariff lines in late and further liberalization is expected with the budget in and beyond to boost trade more trade will help diversify the economy and exports and lift a burden off of the public sector to drive growth it can also actively promote technology absorption skill upgrading and increased competitiveness workers consumers producers and the state will benefit in the longrun as a resultsri lanka can leverage its unique location and trade agreements to overcome the diseconomies of its small scale the colombo port which already sees percent of its volume come from transshipment cargo is poised to grow however sri lanka cannot take its position for granted with high growth in other ports in pakistan and indiaanother way to compete is on speed and cost of trade processing while domestic logistics are inefficient internationally sri lanka is performing better currently it ranks out of on the bmi logistics risk index and places th on the unctad liner shipping connectivity index which ranks countries according to their level of connectedness to international maritime networksthe percontainer cost for exporting and importing to and from sri lanka are much lower than the south asia average but not at world class level respectively us and us south asian average is us and us data to go the extra mile to a regional logistics hub the government has started reforms includingestablishing a trade information portal and the national single window which will streamline trade processing across the plus agencies involvedthe island was ranked th out of economies in the ease of doing business index which shows opportunity for improvement the government has carried out some focused reforms since to improve investment climate and with the expected lag reforms are cropping up in trade across borders was made more efficient and this year improvements are expected relating to starting a business property registration and construction permitsreforms are needed to address critical challenges in areas like land ownership currently land is primarily stateowned in sri lanka and land administration is weak and cumbersome anecdotal evidence points to discouraged fdi projects due to land issues a large share of exports and most export innovation has occurred in a few export processing zones primarily in the western province that are now generally at capacity new sezs are being plannedfurther the boi sri lanka s main fdi facilitation body is transitioning towards modern investment promotion internal revenue act streamlined and improved the efficiency and transparency of incentives applicable to foreign investments in sri lanka the government is also liberalizing the foreign exchange controlspolicy uncertainty in sri lanka hasproven daunting for investors with a lack of information on regulations high fragmentation in policymaking frequent policy changes and slow policy implementation longterm policy strategies can serve as pathsetters and expressed commitment to policy continuity in support of the gosl visionsri lanka has seen little transformation in what it exports over the last years there s been limited innovation and diversification even into nearby product space new products closely related to existing ones which is an easier step that happens organically with investment this difficulty moving into new space has also left the country out of step with regional and global production networks where innovation exists it is limited to a handful of industries a national innovation strategy seeks to address gaps and support startups and smesfinancial products have also remained behind the firm needs eg smes need factoring and leasing supplier finance mechanisms and exportrelated financial instruments now the secured transactions act is being amended to allow one of those innovative products the use of movable collateralefforts are also needed to expand the pool of labor relax constraints in labor laws such as long and costly termination procedure and equip sri lankans with skills in demand in the marketplace in particular sri lanka can benefit tremendously from boosting its female labor force participation rateby addressing issues such as a lack of quality childcare skills mismatch unsafe transport and poor working conditions that keep women away from the labor forcesri lanka could also

china s debtbook diplomacy how china is turning bad loans into strategic investmentsbelt and road is not the marshall plan it s comprised of loans not grants and china expects a return for its moneyby sam parker and gabrielle chefitzthrough its belt and road initiative china is extending hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to developing countries that often can t afford to pay them back in doing so beijing may be looking beyond its bottom line hoping to convert economic loss into geopolitical gaintake the case of hambantota until a decade ago a little fishing town in southern sri lanka a place few could ever envision becoming a geopolitical flashpoint in a chinese stateowned company came in to build a major port financed by chinese loans when the port flopped commercially it became a money pit as sri lanka threw good money after bad in a fruitless attempt to turn the project around despite president maithripala sirisena s campaign promises to reduce sri lanka s dependence on china last year its mounting debt burden drove sirisena s government to sign over the strategicallylocated port to a chinese stateowned company on a year lease the deal has alarmed some us and indian experts who fear that hambantota could one day become a chinese naval outpost in the indian oceanas china continues to loan billions to construct often commercially nonviable infrastructure projects in debtstrapped nations we believe this is a pattern that has the potential to repeat itself in a report published recently by harvard university s belfer center for science and international affairs we identify developing countries from the horn of africa to farflung pacific islands that may become vulnerable to what we ve termed debtbook diplomacy many of these countries have taken on massive chinese loans with little clear prospect for repayment and have strategic assets or diplomatic sway that china could demand such deals could undermine us interests and foreign policy in asiaenjoying this article click here to subscribe for full access just a month sri lanka is hardly the only country taking on eye popping levels of chinese loans the china pakistan economic corridor has ballooned to over billion while chinese loans bumped djibouti s debttogdp ratio up from to percent between and laos and cambodia are so indebted to china that former australian foreign minister gareth evans recently characterized them as wholly owned subsidiaries of china these are just a few of the opaque chinese loans and white elephant development projects scattered across the asia and africaas beijing accumulates more economic leverage through lending recent evidence suggests it won t be shy about using its distinctive stateandmarket model towards advancing the ruling party s global political goals china s practice of geoeconomics has been as creative as it s been proactive from shuttering south koreanowned supermarkets in protest of a missile system deployment to decimating norway s salmon exports as punishment for a chinese dissident winning the nobel prizewith debtbook diplomacy the stakes are much higher than salmon and supermarkets we believe china could apply this debt leverage as a tool to achieve three longstanding strategic goals acquiring a string of ports to project power across south asia undermining us led opposition to its contested south china sea claims and challenging us naval dominance in the pacific as chinese loans begin to mature we see early evidence of this playing out aside from hambantota china has acquired its first overseas naval base in djibouti and controls major chinesebuilt ports in pakistan and myanmar three countries heavily dependent on chinese loans in southeast asia china s subsidiaries laos and cambodia have begun to block asean statements condemning chinese behavior and in oceania china and vanuatu were recently forced to walk back rumors of a potential chinese naval basebelt and road is not the marshall plan it s comprised of loans not grants and china expects a return for its money but it is also not a chinese ploy to mire developing countries in debt this debt leverage is probably more of a useful byproduct than a design feature china s wielding of it more opportunism than grand strategy however what is clear is that these debts will continue to grow and debtor countries will remain on the hook for repayment in one form or anotherthe us certainly does not have a spotless record when it comes to lending overseas risky lending by us banks led to a debt crisis that spread across latin american countries in the s now known as the lost decade of growth for those countries the us offered a voluntary reform plan that sparked riots as a choice between democracy or debt but also pushed american banks to forgive loans and in return they received bonds not ports it s too early to tell how china would respond to widespread defaults but it would have the added ability unavailable to the us banks to squeeze these countries for ports or other nonmonetary repaymentsso what should the us do china is promising more than trillion to developing countries many with real infrastructure needs in the big picture there is very little the us can do to change this dynamic we cannot outbid them nor should we try american companies lack the motivation to match china s massive asian infrastructure investments particularly when many of these projects appear commercially nonviable and there is no mechanism for the us government to direct its companies to do sothis friction between china s staterun economic model and the american free market approach highlights a fundamental tension that has come to define the broader economic relationship between the two superpowers from recent trade talks and the debate around zte to longstanding frustrations over chinese intellectual property theft the trump administration continues to grate against a china it sees as playing by its own economic rules at the expense of us industry and interestswhen it comes to debtbook diplomacy what the us can do is work to blunt the sharpest edges by demonstrating its own commitment to regional partners through a targeted application of american diplomatic economic and military power this includes streamlining our publicprivate investment overseas supporting india s ascendance as a regional leader and strengthening relationships among the usaustraliaindiajapan quad network and encouraging china to become a more responsible creditor while financing independent debt management and contracting expertise to debtor nationsin justifying the decision to sign over hambantota port sri lanka s ports and shipping minister said we had to make a decision to get out of this debt trap but handing over hambantota was a temporary reprieve and for sri lanka and others it may be too late strapped for cash and with its economy slowing earlier this month sri lanka had to take out a new billiondollar loan

jun lbo the united states state department says all is set and president donald trump is well prepared and their position remains clear and unchanged a day ahead of the historic summit with north korea the president and the entire us team are looking forward to tomorrow s summit we have had substantive and detailed meetings to date including this morning with the north koreans the statement saidmeanwhile the us president tweeted on monday morning great to be in singapore excitement in the air a day before his summit with democratic people s republic of korea leader kim jongun in singaporethe full statement by secretary of state mike pompeo of the us follows secretary pompeo it s great to be joining you all here today early in his presidency president trump made a commitment to address the threat of north korea which has been a threat to our nation for far too longpresident trump has been and continues to be committed to ridding the united states and the world of threats posed by north korea s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs these programs threaten our homeland our allies and partners and the broader nonproliferation regime north korea s past activities also make clear that it is proliferation to other actors that creates a risk in addition to the primary risks it has supporting infrastructure that is also of concernin early the trump administration decided on a policy we have referred to as the maximum pressure campaign the campaign enacted the strongest economic and diplomatic sanctions against north korea in history the goal was to set the conditions for the dprk to make a strategic decision to denuclearize as the best means by which it will achieve its own securityamerican leadership rallied the international community to send a strong message to chairman kim jong un and the world that we would not stand for the dprk s illegal weapons programs the president s bold decision to meet with chairman kim jong un grew from this incredibly strong and targeted campaign the president s policy directly led to the historic summit that will take place on june th in singaporeback on march th chairman kim jong un expressed his desire to meet with president trump as soon as possible and then on may th i met with chairman kim jong un in pyongyang and explained america s expectations for denuclearizationat that time we also secured the release of three americans kim dongchul tony kim and kim haksong we view this as a sign of goodwill from chairman kim jong unthe united states and north korea have been holding direct talks in preparation for a summit and north korea has confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearize a comprehensive wholeofgovernment effort in support of president trump s upcoming summit is under way white house and state departmentled advance teams are finalizing logistical preparations and will remain in place in singapore until the summit begins the president continues to follow every development closely and is getting daily briefings from his national security teamthe fact that our two leaders are coming to the table shows that the two sides are very serious the diplomatic model we ve used to date is different from past efforts our efforts give us hope that we can find real success where past efforts have fallen shortpresident trump is hopeful but he s also going into the summit with his eyes wide open we ve seen how many inadequate agreements have been struck in the past and you can be sure that president trump will not stand for a bad deal the united states has been clear time and time again that complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the korean peninsula is the only outcome that we will find acceptablethe president recognizes that north korea has great potential and he looks forward to a day when sanctions on the dprk can begin to be removed however that cannot happen until the dprk completely and verifiably eliminates its weapons of mass destruction programspresident trump and chairman kim will certainly also discuss security assurances for the dprk establishing a peace regime and improving relations between our two countries until we achieve our goals the measures that the world alongside the united states has put on the regime will remain in the event diplomacy does not move in the right direction these measures will increase throughout the entire process the united states has been unified with japan and south korea in response to the threats from north koreai will be traveling with my excuse me i will be traveling to meet with my japanese and south korean counterparts after the summit to continue to coordinate with them i will also stop in beijing following the singapore summit i ll provide them with an update and underscore the importance of fully implementing all sanctions that are imposed on north koreapresident trump recognizes north korea s desire for security and is prepared to ensure a dprk free of its weapons of mass destruction is also a secure north koreapresident trump has made it clear that if kim jong un denuclearizes there is a brighter path for north korea and its people we envision a strong connected secure and prosperous north korea that is integrated into the community of nations we think that the people of the united states and north korea can create a future defined by friendship and collaboration and not by mistrust and fearwe believe that chairman kim jong un shares this positive vision for the future and we are committed to finding a path forward and we assume and hope that that belief is sincerewe re looking forward to being in singapore in just a few dayssanders as a reminder we ll take just a few questions before the secretary has to departrobertaq thank you what progress have you made in narrowing the gap in your understanding of denuclearization and north korea s definition of denuclearization has there been progress in bringing that definition closer togethersecretary pompeo yesq can you describe that a little bitsecretary pompeo nolaughtersanders that was quick jon deckerq thank you sarah thank you secretary pompeo as you mentioned in your remarks north korea in the past has reneged on prior agreements that it s made with the us government so i have two questions for you the first question has to do with your experience meeting with kim jong un do you trust him and my second question has to do with the negotiations that are upcoming with north korea who in your opinion has the upper hand in the negotiations and whysecretary pompeo so with respect to your first question i ve had the chance to meet with chairman kim jong un twice now i can tell you he is very capable of articulating the things that he is prepared to do present clearly the challenges that we all have to overcome it s why the two leaders are meeting it s the opportunity to lay those out clearly between the two leaders so that we can see if we can find a path forward together that achieves the outcomes that both countries wantand your second questionq who has the upper hand in the negotiationssecretary pompeo yeah we don t think about it in terms of who has the upper hand we know this has been a long intractable challenge it s gone on for decades the president has said repeatedly previous administrations weren t prepared to do what we ve done already it s not about who has the upper hand it s about trying to find a way where the two sides can come to an understanding where we can get concrete steps not just words that resolve this challengepamelaq mr secretary first of all the president said that he doesn t believe he needs to prepare very much ahead of this summit do you think that s a prudent approachand also i want to get your reaction to rudy giuliani s comments that kim jong un got back on his hands and knees and begged for the summit to go back on whether you think he should be weighing in on these international affairs and whether you agree with that assessmentsecretary pompeo so back to your second question i took him as it being a small room and not being serious about the comments i think it was a bit in jest and q do you think it could jeopardize the summit or secretary pompeo we re moving forward we re focused on the important things i know rudy rudy doesn t speak for the administration when it comes to this negotiation and this set of issueswith respect to your first question you know progress we re making progress inch by inch and we re going to travel there this is different the approach that president trump is taking is fundamentally different in the past there have been months and months of detailed negotiations and it got nowhere this has already driven us to a place we ve not been able to achieve beforesanders dave boyerq thank you mr secretary the president said today that if the singapore meeting goes well he d like to bring kim jong un to washington possibly for further meetings has kim jong un invited the president to come to north koreasecretary pompeo so i don t want to talk to you about the conversations that have been had between the north korean side and the united states i ll leave that for the president to talk tobut i do want to get to and this comes back to the other question that you asked about the president s preparation so in my previous role and i ve said this before you can look it up there were few days that i left the oval office after having briefed the president that we didn t talk about north korea so over months and months days and days president trump has been receiving briefings on this issue about the military aspects of it the commercial economic aspects of it the history of the relationship and in the past few months there have been neardaily briefings including today where we have been providing the president all the information that he needs and i am very confident that the president will be fully prepared when he meets with his north korean counterpartq just having met the man twice now what can you tell us about what opinions you ve formed of kim jong un as a personsecretary pompeo yeah so i haven t spent that much time with him what i have said publicly is he has indicated to me personally that he is prepared to denuclearize that he understands that the current model doesn t work that he s prepared to denuclearizeand that too he understands that we can t do it the way we ve done it before that this has to be big and bold and we have to agree to making major changes we can t step through this over years but rather need to acknowledge it will take some amount of time that this doesn t happen instantaneously but that the model for succeeding security assurance and political normalization and denuclearization completely verifiably and irreversibly for that to take place we ve got to make bold decisionsand i m hopeful that chairman kim jong un is prepared to make that decision for his country a big shift in his strategic understanding of his securitysanders ayeshaq thank you so you said that you that the president is prepared to talk about security guarantees for north korea we have seen in this administration that you can that when new administrations come in they can undo things that prior administrations have done how can president trump guarantee longterm security for north korea and for kim in particularsecretary pompeo well look we re going to have to do things that convince chairman kim that that s the case all right that s what we ll have to doso let me give you an example we are hopeful that we will put ourselves in a position where we can do something the previous administration didn t do right they signed a flimsy piece of paper and we re hoping to submit a document that congress would also have a say in that would give currency and strength and elongation to the process so that when administrations do change as they inevitably do and this one will six and half years from now when that takes place that chairman kim will have comfort that american policy will continue down the same path on the course that we hope we re able to set in singaporesanders we ll take one last question zekeq thank you mr secretary at the top of your remarks first to follow up briefly on your comments just about asia when you say a document that congress would sign off on are you referring to a treatythen second at the top of your remarks you said that there s also this threat to the united states and its allies from the north koreans wmds as well as ballistic missiles is that a condition for the president in any negotiation agreement with chairman kim that its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons also be part of thatand third finally can you discuss the format of the meeting between the president and chairman kim what will it look like who will be theresecretary pompeo so i ll leave it to the white house to talk about the format of the meetings when the time is rightwith respect to proliferation risk it s very real there is a history of that with respect to north korea and some of our other difficult challenges in the world today they are connected the reason you want complete verifiable and irreversible is precisely that to the extent there remain stockpiles knowledge bases warehouses systems infrastructure fissile material production facilities i could go on to the extent those remain the risk of proliferation continues and it s our aim through the cvid process and providing the security assurances that chairman kim will want that we can greatly reduce the risk that proliferation ever happens as a result of north korean actionssanders thanks so much q one more please sarahq mr secretary can you explain the president s shift when he s gone from talking about defining success for this meeting as denuclearization of the peninsula to now talking about the need for more meetings can you explain what happened there and why this shift and can you also describe your disagreements over north korea internally with the national security advisorsecretary pompeo yeah with respect to the second one i ve read a little bit about this and i love good fiction as next as as much as the next person but it is without foundation so much so that i ll be polite since i m a diplomat now suffice to say those articles are unfounded and a complete jokeq surely there had to be must have been some secretary pompeo oh sure ambassador bolton and i will disagree with great great consistency over time i m confident right we re two individuals we re each going to present our views i m confident that will happen on issues from how long this press conference ought to go laughs to issues that really matter to the worldso it s absolutely the case that ambassador bolton and i won t always agree and i think the president demands that we each give him our own viewsq inaudiblesecretary pompeo yeah so you had a first your first question i ll try to answer i ll try to answer your first question too i don t see the shift as disjunctive as you do the president has always understood that this was a process it s been very clear that there would that it would always take a great deal of work to do thisso i think your you can interpret it how you will but i think your characterization of that also doesn t reflect the president s understanding i think his understanding about this process has been pretty consistent since i ve been working with him now almost a year and a half ago

june lbo the british press is full of tributes following the unexpected demise of sir desmond de silva qc most major media publications in the uk explored and saluted his brilliant career and its legacythe sri lankan media seem to have failed to recognise the significance of one of the nation s greatest sons and therefore i feel compelled to share some of my thoughtsmy qualification to pen this piece is lacking i have probably spent less than hours in close quarters with sir desmond others have worked with him or known him for a lifetime many are familiar with his place in the british establishment something that a sri lankan american like myself has limited understanding of however despite my limited contextual background on the man i feel compelled to writei first got to know about sir desmond over a decade ago i was in my mid twenties at the time i had gone on a trip to kandy my wife had heard of a place called helga s folly which was owned an operated by sir desmond s sister helga was known to my wife s family and my wife wanted to visit her eclectic hotel and take a look it was during the time of the war and thus the property was almost deserted however despite the lack of people i was bowled over by the sense of style that emanated from every corner of the place i believe the property was originally owned by their grandfather george de silva freedom fighter and member of sri lanka s first cabinetwhat most fascinated me were pictures on the wall of their family history it was on those walls that i saw the press clippings of desmond de silva qc the articles described a man at the very top of the legal profession in the uk as a lawyer i was fascinated that there was a past pupil of trinity college kandy who had reached the absolute pinnacle of the profession in the ukfrom then on desmond de silva qc was an entity to me he was a man of stature and significance that l looked up to over the years i would continue to follow and read about him from time to time little did i realise that the larger than life queens counsel i read about on those walls was still yet to move on to his greatest accomplishmentsdesmond de silva was later knighted for his service to the legal profession he was made a member of the privy council most significantly he made it to the rank of under secretary general of the united nations where he was the chief prosecutor who brought charles taylor former president of liberia and war criminal to justice in the legal profession throughout the world it is hard to find a record so diverse and accomplished as sir desmond de silva ssir desmond is possibly one of the most accomplished persons to be born on sri lankan soil unlike most revered figures in sri lanka here was a man who came not to the top of the nation but to the top of the world order he did this as a professional and with panacheas fate would have it our paths would eventually cross about months ago we hosted lord mark malloch brown at the horton debate society dinner organised by lanka business online lbo as the head of lbo i was the master of ceremonies for the event mark malloch brown like sir desmond was also a former undersecretary general of the un as under secretary he served as kofi annan s chief of staff lord malloch brown together with kofi annan ran the united nations with sir desmond as their chief prosecutorlord mark mallochbrown at the horton debate society dinner in colombo sri lankaas the seating arrangements for the horton debate dinner were made it should have been obvious that sir desmond should have been seated next to lord malloch brownhowever at this point i did something selfish sir desmond was a hero of mine and i set the seating so that he would be next to me at the far end of the head table from lord malloch brown i wanted the conversation with sir desmond to be with me sir desmond graciously accepted his seat at the wrong end of the table next to meas the dinner went on i was dumbfounded i was sitting next to one of my personal heroes and the conversation was not flowing i had hours next to him and was unsure if i was even making a good impression perhaps neither of us had enough wine to loosen up or perhaps sir desmond was wondering why he was sitting next to me instead of lord malloch brownas i guided the crowd through lord malloch brown s speech and qa i lined up the final question sir desmond wanted to say something and i was the one who was going to give him the microphone i thus launched into a prepared introduction that showed sir desmond that i knew exactly who he wasthen he stood up years old took the microphone and quietly began to speak at first he was a little quiet and i was not sure if he would be able to command the attention of the crowd then it happened one of greatest moments that we have had in the horton debate sir desmond launched into a speech about how he and malloch brown worked together in order to execute the unprecedented arrest of charles taylor finishing the speech with the closing phrase no one is above the law the crowd was stunned and erupted into applause here was sir desmond coming in with his closing argument to steal the show just as i imagine he had done countless times in the courtroomas i was escorting lord malloch brown out of the event he said to me that if i were ever going to have him again as a guest speaker that we must fly sir desmond in also to be by his side lord malloch brown was clearly struck by sir desmond s oration and i am sure when he thinks of sri lanka he will think of sir desmond that eveningas the months went on i became a close friend of the hon nirj deva mep another great sri lankan nirj had known sir desmond for a lifetime both were sri lankans that made it to the top in the uk both were active in the conservative party and both were involved in sri lankan affairs from time to time sir desmond being a decade his senior seemed the elder statesman in the relationshipas fortune would have it hon nirj deva was going to be spending the weekend with sir desmond and family on his taprobane island in weligama he serendipitously invited my wife and i to join them for the day we were greeted by sir desmond and his daughter victoria s warm hospitality the day was a myriad of cocktails lunch tea wine and what would have been a long night of great conversation however when the champagne started to come out my wife knew that i would be unable to keep up with these two old hands and we subsequently excused ourselvesin those several hours with sir desmond and hon nirj deva i learned about personal interactions with dozens of global leaders i learned law from one of its greatest practitioners and was treated to an old world roaring intellectual discourse that seems hard to come by in this day and age the interaction was special to me and i will cherish the opportunity i had to engage in peer level interaction with these two great men the day it came out i bought sir desmond s book madam where are your mangoes i had to know morewhen you read his book it becomes clear sir desmond is one of the most substantial global entities that sri lanka has ever produced today we are ruled by politicians who have limited ethics education and experience we leave our future and the future of our children in their hands we do this while we let the most accomplished sri lankans like sir desmond save the worldsri lankans have emerged everywhere on the world stage we should be entrusting our children s future to the best of them the national list is a brilliant aspect of sri lanka s parliament that allows political parties to bring leaders into the government from outside electoral politics the leaders of sri lanka s political parties should get much more out of the national list as a nation we should have got so much more out of sir desmond the world was not so foolish and sir desmond s contribution to it was monumental sir desmond sri lanka has missed you dearly

to handle them and how well equipped you are to do so will differ but it is important to keep a positive attitude be committed to your goals and enjoy everything you do you will face many challenges early in life but it is important to view them as opportunities and tackle them head on these are learning experiences that will shape you and your future later on in life there will be a completely different set of challenges your focus may be split between family and work but it is important to be equally committed work on being a multitasker be clear in your communication and have a positive attitude there is no such thing as an unsurmountable challenge everything is possible and that s the mindset you need to have she saidbuilding on prasansani s point dr dulini fernando associate professor at the warwick business school university of warwick uk explained to the audience that one of the most important lessons she learned in her life was to not over analyze things and block out everyone s voice except her own i feel that a lot of these things women face can sometimes be in our minds people will always say things but it s important for us to not take notice of it garbage in garbage out because if we stop to think about everything people say to us it will take up all our time and may even make you feel victimized which will only hinder your ability to manage and be detrimental to your career remember that you can be your own worst enemy being aware of that can help you to get out of your own way she said it s not an easy task but you can train your mind over time to achieve this until everything else is white noise she addedin the final moments of the discussion echoing the thoughts of her fellow panelists and touching upon the underlying theme of everything discussed renuka fernando explained that women need to be comfortable in what they want to be and it should be for them their family and their employer nothing else matters we have to admit to ourselves that we are only human society usually places heavy demands on us to be super career women super daughters super wives super daughterinlaws and super mothers but we have to realize that we are not super everything all the time depending on the situation we may be super career women or super mothers but we cannot be all things to all people all the time you need to be confident in what you are doing is right for you your family and your employer this alone can be a huge challenge for women in sri lankan society but we can overcome it she saidmedia release

key highlights of the seminar on challenges in meeting emerging trends in the dairy industry organized by the all island dairy association the local dairy sector adds about to gdp and has increased supply from mn litres in to mn litres in yet still meets only of sri lanka s growing demand revealing a productivity and supply gap in addition of milk comes from smallholder farmers who encounter challenges leading to inconsistent quality standards in milk collected imported milk powder prices are controlled despite a per cent vat being introduced in and the increase of other input costs to ensure future sustainability of the industry a price formula is recommended to replace price control collaboration between government and industry on current regulations and supporting farmers in overcoming their challenges will lead to a thriving industrythe all island dairy association aida organized a seminar on challenges in meeting emerging trends in the dairy industry recently at the ceylon chamber of commerce aida representing a wide range of dairy industry stakeholders such as milk producers processors importers and service and input providers organized this seminar with the main objective of discussing emerging trends in dairy industry educating businesses in the dairy industry on new regulations pertaining to dairy products and agreeing on a way forward to face these challengesthe discussion covered key topics such as the main issues facing the sector current barriers to meeting the local industry s potential and how the government and industry needs to collaborate to overcome these barriersmr nishantha jayasooriya president of the all island dairy association aida making opening remarks stated that of milk comes from smallholder farmers we see a lot of enthusiasm among farmers to increase local milk production as fresh milk is profitable for dairy farms he identified a gap in the quality of milk due to the lack of access to the right equipment knowledge on proper dairy practices and proper chilling facilities which is harmful especially when maintaining a consistent standard of quality because of this a lot of the yield is rejected and wasted said jayasooriyamr asoka bandara executive committee member of the all island dairy association speaking on current milk regulations and dairy industry highlighted that the local dairy sector has increased its supply from million litres in to million litres in yet still meets only of sri lanka s growing dairy consumption revealing a clear gap in supply and demandbandara said fresh milk may be profitable for farmers who may earn up to rs per litre as per our calculations however processors are squeezed between ever increasing costs throughout the entire value chain and a fixed milk price for milk products especially for milk powder he highlighted the incongruity of pricecontrolled milk powder undergoing a vat inclusion in whilst global milk prices inflation and rupee devaluation continued to increase cost to the industryhe noted that the industry had requested the government to collaborate on a solution by replacing the restrictive price control with a transparent and predictable price formula to determine milk powder prices he urged the government to collaborate with the industry and consider other avenues to drive the industry forward in a sustainable mannerdr susantha mallawarachchi a vice president of aida explained that most of the issues faced by local dairy farmers are due to poor practices and a negative attitude towards dairy farming he pointed out that certain farm management issues such as lack of cow comfort tethering and improper levels of feed and water are reasons for productivity and quality gaps he highlighted the need to improve the quality of local milk stressing the opportunity of working with smallholder farmers to transform them into prosperous entrepreneurs through introducing modern dairy farm practices the dairy sector adds only about to sri lanka s gdp this is because dairy farming is now commonly considered as a second income earner we need to change our attitude towards dairy farmers they are not only farmers they are entrepreneurs dr mallawaarachchi saidin addition to the challenges of the local dairy industry the seminar also focused on the importance of dairy nutrition as part of a balanced dietaddressing the topic of milk energy and malnutrition dr renuka jayatissa consultant medical nutritionist medical research institute shared a nutrition analysis that indicated the nutrition quality of both fresh milk and powdered milk and recommended the consumption of dairy in other formats as well to meet the daily nutritional requirements all forms of dairy are nutritious in recommended quantities ie ml of milk g or pot of yoghurt or g of cheese therefore our focus should also extend to producing more dairy formats like yoghurt and cheese not just milk she saidthe discourse on the nutrition in dairy also addressed the need for dairy products with little or no added sugar another key focus for the industry currently the industry s commitment to continuously reducing sugar levels in products was reiterated albeit through a gradual process considering consumers needs and taste palettesthe seminar was followed up by a panel discussion moderated by dr nelum withana executive committee member of aida the ensuing panel discussion was the first of its kind held by the aida and featured perspectives from the speakers ie mr asoka bandara dr susantha mallawa arachchi dr renuka

maldiveshm what were the areas of discussion at the workshop and what were the techniques and strategies discussed at the workshopthe workshop was focused on finance but through the other functions of running a hotel the most important aspect we covered was the staff staff is everything i am a strong believer in people if you take care of your staff they will give their all to the job and the guests will come back and when the guests come back automatically the revenue will improve so although we touched on finance we also touched on other areas such as working as a team to achieve profits and being proactive we also delved into other areas such as banking and revenue managementhm which areas of the hospitality industry was the workshop focused onwe covered areas such as management of sales and front office function fb function housekeeping function managing receivables and inventory etchm what were some of the issues and ideas that were highlighted during the workshopone of the issues highlighted were budget budget changes due to weather political situations economic conditions etc while some costs of running a hotel are fixed others are more variable what i always suggest is to sit with your team not as an accountant or gm but as one of them and discuss where you could cut costs the team knows everything get ideas from your staff and save money in different areas you cannot be a winner by being dictatorialanother area we highlighted is the importance of having a proper credit policy credit limits must not be exceeded you have to have proper documentation we also touched on other areas such as ethics good governance honesty transparency and the importance of having a good internal audit reporthm you ve been engaged in the hotel industry for the past thirty three years what is your perspective of the hospitality industry of the maldivesmaldives is a premium destination and the industry has shown stable growth throughout history i have to admit my perception of the maldives as a country was different when i came here mostly due to ignorance but the experience i had here completely changed my mind i had a most seamless experience from the airport to the hotelhm what are some of the areas hoteliers in the maldives should focus on improving enhancing and how do you propose hoteliers address the issuesmy advice would be and we discussed this in the workshop do not drop rates for shortterm gains because you cannot increase rates once you drop it instead look to save money elsewhere and come to the same bottom line come up with innovative ways to save money during the low seasondon t try drastic promotions as that will be detrimental to the name instead keep the perception as a highend destination the maldives has a lot of potential but also has to continue to attract business the maldives has to continue having that market edge that competitive edge you absolutely always have to train new ideas and come up with new innovationshm is there anything you would like to addi have to reiterate the experience i had in the maldives i had a very seamless experience throughout everything is perception first impressions are everything and that is something you should work on maintaining giving a good experience from the time the guests arrive all the way to when they leave you have to work together with the government to improve and regulate the airport experience word of mouth is the best advertisement i m going back with good memories i will go back and talk to two three people about my time here and they in turn will talk to two or three more people everything is word of mouthnirmalan has more than years of strong financial administration experience at fivestar hotels in various regions of the world such as

prof ricardo hausmann briefs boi staff on economic development the way forward discussedprof ricardo hausmann director of the center for international development and professor of the practice of economic development at the john f kennedy school of government harvard university visited boi and addressed staff of the boardthe professor was accompanied by other staff members from harvard university prof ricardo hausmann was introduced to the staff by mr duminda ariyasinghe director general of boi the boi director general spoke about the introduction of new systems at the board to facilitate foreign direct investments into the country ariyasinghe also briefed the visiting scholar on boi setting up new teams to research and promote investments in specific industries or sectors he also spoke of a focus on promoting reinvestments by existing investors in sri lankaprof ricardo haussmann began by stating that he was excited to hear about new opportunities and challenges that the boi is undergoing he identified sri lanka s main problem as the inability to move from the production of comparatively simple products such as apparel into technologically more advanced sectors the success of countries such as vietnam was their capacity to move from apparel to sectors such as electronics and machinery production even though they had stated with apparel production at the same time as sri lankaconsequently fdi did not contribute in a major way towards the growth of the sri lankan economy since it amounts currently just of the gdp whilst in countries such as vietnam singapore fdi had grown to represent as much as to of the gdpprof haussmann spoke of a need to allocate more land for industrial development and noted that until very recently there had not been any significant effort to develop new industrial zones in sri lankaanother important aspect was that prof hausmann linked immigration to economic development he told the boi staff that a restrictive immigration policy would not favour development since this would shut out many skilled persons from overseas from contributing to the country s developmentcurrently there were just foreign workers in the country or approximately one person out of this is in contract with australia where of the population is of foreign originhowever prof hausmann said that while there are lessons that can be learnt from examples overseas each country was distinctive and like a skilled tailor it was necessary to develop for sri lanka a tailor made suit that would fit the country perfectly boi staff also conducted power point presentations for prof hausmann the first conducted by mr mahinda ramanayake executive director investor services described the efforts undertaken to encourage existing investors to reinvest and utilize the networks of existing investors thereafter steps are taken to identify suppliers and partners of existing investors in sri lanka and encourage the latter to establish themselves in the country as new projects some results had been achieved with regard to companies from europe already established in sri lankaboi also conducted presentations on target sectors including food processing mineral products and export services responding to the presentations prof hausmann stated that it was very important to understand not just successes but also challenges or even failures that one facedfor example in japan hausmann noted managers who identified that a project faced challenges were highly regarded and concerted efforts were made to correct whatever shortcoming that may exist hausmann also added that the nature of a zone s projected future industries would determine the best possible location for it for example logistics zones would be largely dependent on proximity to a port or airport while certain types of industries would not require thatthe professor also stated that the existence of deposits of mineral resources in a country does not necessarily mean that an advanced industry can be built around this resource for example australia exports bauxite which is found in abundance in that country but has not gone into the production of aluminium because of its prohibitive energy costprof hausmann saw logistics as a sector that offers considerable opportunities however to function effectively the many approvals and problems that the industry may face ought to be also addressed to ensure that the sector operates in a smooth mannerprof hausmann also commented on the automobile industry and saw the proximity of india s automobile industry in chennai as a potential opportunity for sri lanka s own objective to develop a home grown automotive industrythe visit by prof ricardo haussmann to sri lanka follows some of his earlier visits and interaction with the board of investment of sri lanka ministry of development strategies and international trade and other sri lankan institutions the visit by this distinguished scholar and his team was a unique opportunity for the boi to discuss and share knowledge and experiencesmedia release

 dissecting their relationship to guide regulation bilesha weeraratne geetha is an unskilled and uneducated female from rural sri lanka as she was saddled with financial issues and could not find a suitable job in sri lanka she decided to seek employment in saudi arabia as a female domestic worker fdw however geetha was clueless about how to proceed and thankfully somadasa a sub agent from her village helped her through the entire process now geetha has a job for which she did not have to pay any recruitment fees that pays her a steady monthly income of lkr she also received over lkr as an upfront incentive for taking up the jobsub agents like somadasa play a significant role in the recruitment of migrant workers from sri lanka however todate sub agents are informal stakeholders in the recruitment process as such currently there is increasing interest in sri lanka to regulate sub agents and hold themaccountable for their conduct in this context ips carried out a studyto better understand the relationship between migrants and sub agents and provide empirical evidence for policy recommendations toregulate sub agents in sri lanka this blog is based on the findingsof the studyrole of sub agentssub agents play a critical role in recruitment for foreign employment from sri lanka by linking potential migrants with licensed recruitment agents licensed recruitment agents often operate in the city centers considerably far off from the rural villages where potential migrants reside this geographical distance limits licensed recruitment agents from adequately reaching out to their clientele at the same time theregulatory framework in sri lanka restricts licensed recruitment agents from establishing branch officesas a remedy to these legislative and capacity constraints licensed recruitment agents have evolved to rely on sub agents who informally operate at the grass root level in areas where potential migrants originate from to work as a conduit between a licensed agent and a potential migrantthis working arrangement between licensed agents and sub agents also fits perfectly with the needs of lowskilled potential migrant workers like geetha who come from less educated backgrounds and belong to the lowest socioeconomic stratum of society for them the recruitment process for foreign employment is often strange intimidating and complicated as such these potential migrants are often reluctant to directly approach a licensed recruitment agent but are more willing to go to a sub agent who is usually a known person from their village moreover despite the absence of a formal recognition for sub agents migrants have the misconception that sub agents are formal stakeholders in the recruitment process as such the services of sub agents are common in recruitment of female domestic workers fdw to the gulf cooperation council gcc countriesmisconduct however not all sub agents in sri lanka are genuine like somadasa and not all migrants are as lucky as geetha as informal stakeholders in the recruitment process sub agents are often criticisedfor their contribution to debt bondage and trafficking over charging forging documents and misuse of power ie illegally withholding the passports of potential migrants in the recruitment process for foreign employment the informal nature of their role and the absence of a regulatory framework to control their conduct contribute to low accountability and high levels of misconduct by sub agentsas such the government of sri lanka is attempting to regulate sub agents however regulating these informal stakeholders is a complicated exerciseefforts to regulate sub agentssimilar to the rest of south asian sending countries sri lanka has previously tried and failed to regulate sub agents in the sri lanka bureau of foreign employment slbfe issued identification cards to sub agents through the respective licensed agents however there were more sub agents operating in the field than registered and as a result unethical and unregulated activities of sub agents continued as such in the slbfe issued a circular requesting all licensed agents to return the identification cards issued to their respective subagents this circular implies the government position of not recognisingthe operation of sub agents however the slbfe did not take action against the nonreturn of identity cards or the continued operation of sub agentsnow there is renewed interest to regulate sub agents specifically in march a cabinet paper with recommendations to regularize sub agents was submitted by then ministry of foreign employment while the slbfe is actively engaged in attempts to revise its act to incorporate regulation of sub agentsone common element across all these failed attempts is the lack of empirical evidence to guide regulatory efforts the following are some interesting empirical findings on theunique and dynamic relationship between migrants and sub agents that are valuable for regulating sub agentsfindingsbased on rigorous analysis the ips study finds thatmigrant s misconception that the sub agent is a formal stakeholder leads to lower probability to migrate lower promised wages and lower promised incentiveswhen potential migrants are unaware of a sub agents actual formal status and have a misconception that they are formal potential migrants are more likely to be intimidated leading to accepting lower wage and incentive offers similarly with such intimidation potential migrants are less likely to follow up and pressurise sub agents about migrationcollection of the migrants passports by sub agents leads to lower promised wages and promised incentives but a higher probability to migrateas per the existing regulations as informal stakeholders sub agents have no authority to collect passports however in practice it is the sub agent who initially collects the passport from the potential migrant and hands it over to a licensed recruitment agent as such there are instances where sub agents hold on to passports while they shop around for alternative licensed recruitment agents until an attractive commission is offered to the sub agent simultaneously this submission of passport deprives the potential migrant of alternative offers as she is unable to approach other licensed agents or sub agents this leads to lower bargaining power and related lower promised wages and incentives for potential migrants however lower financial outcomes are in the context of higher chance of migrating because a passport is needed to process the final steps of the migration process and often these final steps are carried out by the sub agent on behalf of the licensed agenta sub agent requesting money for his services leads to higher promised wages and higher promised incentives but a lower probability to migratethe status quo for recruitment of a fdw to the gcc countries involves zero recruitment cost to migrants yet this finding reveals that recruitment fees are collected by sub agents resulting in contradictory implications to potential migrants higher promised wages and incentives coupled with lower chance of migration reflect the misleading nature of sub agents with over promise and under delivery fraudulent sub agents often offer unrealistically good recruitment packages with slim chance of actual migration and attempt to earn an income by misleading potential migrantstransition from potential to current migrant enables migrants to realize the actual status of sub agentsgiven that sub agents are informal stakeholders migrants start to realisethe former s actual status through own experience but this selfrealisationrequires one to go through the entire recruitment process and perhaps endure exploitation abuse vulnerability lower incentives and wages and lower probability to migrate if this information can be provided earlier on in the recruitment process potential migrants could be saved from adverse experiences in the recruitment process and possibly ensured better outcomes in terms of wages incentives and probability to migraterecommendationsthe findings of the study provide valuable information to shape proposed

increase in fuel prices and economic mismanagementfollowing the recent increase in fuel prices transport costs and the prices of goods and services have started rising fishermen are up in arms against the sudden increase in the price of kerosene by more than double the earlier price and the creation of a coupon system to distribute subsidized kerosene in the midst the agitation and unrest resulting from this fuel price increase members of the government have been trying to justify it by saying that fuel costs were higher during the rajapaksa government today the price of a barrel of crude oil is around usd when i assumed office as president back in november it was around usd it reached the highest point of usd in june and even as late as august the price was over usd it was only in the last three months of that oil prices started declining and by the time the government changed in january it had gone down to usd per barrelfrom that point onwards oil prices remained at a low level for three years the prices kept declining and reached a low of usd by february thereafter oil prices increased slowly but even as late as october it was less than usd it is only in the last few months that oil prices have steadily risen to reach the present level of usd during the nine full years in which i ruled the country we never had the benefit of low oil prices the present price of usd per barrel is quite low compared to the average price of crude oil during my government despite the highest global crude oil prices in history during those years we not only won the war against terrorism which many people thought was unwinnable but also successfully concluded the biggest infrastructure building programme ever seen in this country since the colonial era we were able to do all that while maintaining the fertilizer subsidy so as to shield farmers from the increasing prices of fertilizer despite high oil prices my government was able to maintain the highest growth rates in sri lanka s history and the per capita gdp increased threefold during my tenure in powerthe yahapalana government has had the benefit of very low crude oil prices and savings totaling more than usd five billion were made in foreign exchange over the past three years yet the economy has been in steady decline and development work ceased completely during that period last saturday the present finance minister said that if he had been holding that position in january he would not have given concessions to win applause from the gallery thereafter a unp backbencher echoed much the same views the reference made by the minister to concessions given to win applause from the gallery was probably to the rs allowance for government servants and the reduction in the prices of fuel gas and certain foodstuffs that were made by this government soon after winning the presidential election all these were in fact pledges given in maithripala sirisena s presidential election manifesto to win voteswhat they told the people was that all these concessions can be given once the rajapaksa s were ousted and corruption was stopped after winning the presidential election they carried out the pledges given in order to win the parliamentary elections that were to soon follow what we are seeing now is the result of using government finances for political purposes any government can give any concession they like to win elections what usually acts as a restraint in this regard is the question as to how they are going to find the money to fulfill those commitments after winning the present government thought only of winning the election not about what happens afterwards having committed public funds to win elections this government then began the biggest borrowing spree in sri lanka s history to meet the increased expenditure from january to date this government has borrowed a total of around usd billion in foreign currency commercial loans and well over six trillion in rupee loans even though the prime minister claims at every gathering he addresses that the present economic situation is due to the project loans taken by my government it is really due to the short and medium term consumption loans taken by the present governmentaccording to the finance ministry the foreign currency loans that have to be repaid in alone amounts to usd billion that is much more than the combined cost of all three phases of the norochcholai coal power plant the two phases and bunkering facility of the entire hambantota port the southern highway up to godagama the colombokatunayake highway and the mattala airport all put together members of the public may have noticed that when the indian oil company increased the price of petrol by rs per liter the ceylon petroleum corporation increased the price by more than twice that today even at usd a barrel world crude oil prices are much lower than they were when i was in power and the government can provide fuel at a lower cost by reducing the tax on petroleum products but that is unlikely to happen because the yahapalana government needs the money to pay for the concessions given to win the last presidential and parliamentary elections when power hungry politicians literally pledge the treasury as collateral to achieve their political goals it is the people of the country who will finally have to pay the pricemahinda

interview on food safetyand nutrition with dr krishanthi premarathnethe great majority of people will experience a food borne disease at some point in their lives this highlights the importance of making sure the food we eat is not contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria parasites viruses toxins and chemicals food can be contaminated at any point during production distribution and preparation everyone along the production chain from producer to consumer has a role to play to ensure the foods we eat are met with proper safety standardsin this article dr krishanthi premarathne research member at sri lanka safety and quality assurance laboratory and a senior lecturer at wayamba and peradeniya universities of sri lanka talks about the importance of food safety along with insightful reveal on poultry products of sri lanka where she especially addressed the rumors pertaining to yellow chicken q food safety in any country is a vital part can you please explain what food safety is and what aspects we need to fulfill to achieve maximum safety when it comes to food in sri lankaafood safety is concerned with safe sources of all foods and their positive nutritional impact on people this encompasses inspection and enforcement of all stages from producer to consumer from being free of chemical and microbial contaminations to safe storage transportation labeling preparation processing cooking and serviceq with the fast track life style our healthy diet habits tend to drift away most often how can we fall into the right track againa no matter how much you may want to make healthy choices it can feel like there simply isn t timebeing cautious on personal food habits lessening fastfood and sugar consumption fall into the food safety category and are consumer controlled aspects them making healthier diet choices will boost food safety and ultimately will contribute to a healthier societythere are ample ways to make a healthier living namely filling up your meals with iron turning the big meals into soups a salads eat full meals rather than snacking all day eat mindfully knowing what you are consuming and what nutrients it offers daily consumption of vegetables pump up the protein turn tv time to fitness time and stay hydrated at all timesq currently we find pesticides in products hormones in milk and antibioticsin meat leaving consumers to suffer major health risks what is your view on this a modern production of foods incorporates a wide range of synthetic chemicals potential that are damaging to humans if they are exposed to high concentrations or to low concentrations over an extended period of time yetusage of these pesticides is unavoidable since it has become essential for the production process however the effects can be reduced by boiling peeling or washing the residue off and adding spices that cuts off all toxic entities in the cooking process or the best thing is simply to grow your own vegetables and fruitswhen it comes to meat products cutting off the excess fat and skin is a good practice to follow as it could have absorbed unwanted pesticide residue however the sri lankan consumer is falsely advertised about having hormones injected to broiler chickens when considering the time cost and the fact that hormone imports are restricted there is no way that these statements are trueq consumers often pay attention to the colour factor when selecting meat products and it has been rumoured that most consumers assume that the yellowish hue in yellow chicken is due to expiration what is your feedback with regard to thisa the yellow hue in the chicken meat is mainly due to the presence of the natural colourant named carotenoids corn is a primary natural source of carotenoids that have been used in chicken feed over the past few decades by many well reputed poultry farms mainly in america united kingdom australia and india birds as a whole are unable to produce carotenoids in their body hence it enters a body through the food intake of a chicken yellow corn and maize as chicken feed produce ample amounts of carotenoids and they are stored in high concentrations in the skin liver fat and most noticeably in egg s yolk otherwise the yellow hue does not imply expiration or bad quality q are there any specialties in chicken with the yellow hue comparison to the regular chickens a yes corn is a grain filled with fiber which consists of water also caloriesvitamin and mineral supplements which positively benefit to regulate a normal growth increase bone health optimal kidney functioning maintenance of good heart rate and acts as a source of antioxidants of chicken it only contains sugar and the protein percentage is in the range of therefore makes an excellent diet for the growth of healthy chickens similarly corn fed chicken variety contains higher volumes of vitamin a than regular chicken that are generally fed with a grain based diet hence it is ideal for better vision a healthy immune system and cell growthfurther irish poultry experts as well as the american british australian and indian poultry professionals have proven that the golden hue produced in cornfed chicken simply is a measurement of exposing the quality standard and have stated that using corn as chicken feed does boost the taste of the chicken and gives an exceptionally succulent roasted flavor

 by professor buddhi marambewe in sri lanka have a history to be proud of according to our historical record the golden age of sri lankan agriculture production centers around polonnaruwa during reign of king parakramabahu the great ad at that time sri lanka was known as the granary of the east and the nation s prosperity expanded substantially during this era mainly owing to the epic scale of rice cultivation and reported exports this flourishing peasant agricultural sector was later destroyed during different ancient regimes and through the colonial invasions of the portuguese dutch and british thusshifting the country s agriculture to a plantationbasedmodelin colonial and postcolonial sri lanka we witnessed the shrinking of the country s agriculture sector where sri lanka went from being the granary of the east to a nation that in the s was importing as much as of our rice even from myanmar to feed a population of just million at that time we were proudly using traditional technologies without any agrochemicals and the average yield stood at approximately tonnes per hectareby our population had grown to million people yet we were able to increase productivity to tonnes per hectare representing an increase in total paddy production in the magnitude of times compared to that of this was despite only marginal increases in extents of rice cultivation which expanded by only times over the past years meaning that the bulk of this increased production was almost exclusively a result of new agricultural technologies this massive improvement was made possible due to improved education research extensionand adoption of new technologies including agrochemicals fertilizers and pesticides together with the extension of health and education servicesthis is a classic example how we have continued to feed our nation minimizing foreign exchange drain on import of the major staple and surviving global food and foodprice crisis experienced in the pastin the past two years sri lanka s agriculture sector was negatively affected partly due to drastic climate change and partly as a result of policy changes made without scientific evidencethe impact of climate change has been discussed at length in previous articles written by the author however the recent policy changes made without any consideration of scientific evidence including the removal of timetested weed control tools due to their alleged involvement in chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology ckdu have exacerbated the negative impacts of climate change affecting both food and plantation crops given that weeding remains the most troublesome biological constraint to any crop production it is evident that these types of short sighted policies cannot last much longer the glyphosate sagaglyphosatewas imported to sri lanka with the intervention of the tea research institute tri of sri lanka in with initial use being confined to experimental use on roadsides ravines boundaries and abandoned tea fields for the control of weeds such as torpedo grass panicum repensa year later in following evaluations on preliminary experimental use and following tri recommendations sri lanka started using the herbicideon such areas at a national scale and by the mahaweli development authority of sri lanka was involved inexperiments using the herbicide in zero tillage systems which were later abandoned glyphosate was later recommended by tri to be used in pruned tea fields and mature plucking fields after three pruning cycles to control troublesome weeds in after successfully completing the herbicide residue trials in tea and for general weed control in tea in the department of agriculture doa evaluated the herbicide for weed control during land preparation of rice in and recommended the herbicide for preplant weed control in rice in however the herbicide did not initially attract paddy farmers due to availability of the low cost and quickacting herbicide paraquat at that time when paraquatwas banned in through a phased out process following several incidents of suicide utilizing the herbicide and expired patent rights by monsanto for their popular glyphosatebased herbicide numerous secondmakers flooded the international market with such herbicides at a cheaper cost consequently glyphosate became popular among paddy and maize growers in addition to those in tea plantationsaccording to croplifesri lanka of the glyphosate imported in tea consumed maize and other field crops wet zone paddy and dry zone paddy glyphosate was restricted for use in december in five main districts where paddy was cultivated in sri lanka this decision was mainly based on a hypothesis paper published by a group of sri lankan scientists in february that first considered a hypothetical link between glyphosate and ckdu the herbicide was banned from importation and use in june the impact of the absence of effective weed control technique in tea cultivation has been discussed and debated heavily recently the planters association pa has estimated a loss of rs billion per year due to the ban of glyphosate mainly owing to increased cost of production arising out of high cost of labourintensive alternate weeding techniques or abandoning weed control in tea fields due to scarce and costly labour resources it is our economy that has been threatened due to this unwise nonscientific decision in banning glyphosatethe fao of un and world food programme wfp produced a special report on food security in sri lanka in june and stated that until recently farmers relied heavily on the use of the herbicide glyphosate roundup to control weeds in their paddy fields in a presidential decree banned its use in most agricultural sectors in the belief that it was responsible for the high incidence of chronic kidney disease amongst paddy farmers especially in north central north western uva and eastern provinces in the absence of glyphosate paddy fields often have a high weed population in a year of reduced rainfall this is especially harmful as the weeds which are often more adapted than the crop to dry conditions use a large proportion of the available soil moisture it is clear that our national food security has also been challenged as a result of this ad hoc decision to ban a proven weed control techniqueincreasing incidence of ckdu in dry zone of sri lanka has drawn the attention of many scientists and medical practitioners and researchers given that the causal factor of ckdu remain unknown it has been dubbed as having a multifactoral origin by medical professionals from peradeniya and kandy who with long years of experience of this disease in the country there is no argument that the affected communities should be treated and no new incidence of the disease should emergeat a recent press conference held on march organized by the national research council nrc to commemorate the world water day the scientists including a wellrespected nephrologist has made it clear that there is no conclusive evidence to say that pesticides are linked with the disease moreover the who sinternational expert consultation on ckduheld in colombo in april where the author of this article was also invited as an agronomist reported that there is no conclusive evidence to implicate glyphosate and other agrochemicals as a cause for the diseaseckdu was first recorded in early s in the north central province where paddy cultivation is dominant however the herbicide glyphosate was recommended to be used in paddy fields only in therefore associations explained by some researchers between glyphosate and ckdustand out as being highly questionabledeviating away from the hypothetical links of the herbicide to ckdu some scientists claim that the herbicide ban should be continued as it is categorized as a probable carcinogen class a by the who since march this was based on the recommendation of the frenchbased organization called international association for research on cancer iarc this highly debated and controversial categorization has been challenged by many countries and organizations there were even claims for conflicts of interest of those involved in decisionmakingin may the joint report of faowho meeting on pesticide residues clearly states that the meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to be genotoxic at anticipated dietary exposures if further noted that glyphosate is not carcinogenic in rats but could not exclude the possibility that it is carcinogenic in mice at very high doses further the report states in view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at humanrelevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures the meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet considering these results and other studies conducted by independent research groups the eu voted in november to renew the license of glyphosate for another five years with countries supporting nine opposing and one abstaining this is despite the fact that many antiglyphosate lobbies have been waiting impatiently to see the product banned moreover among the nine countries voted against four have opposed as they wanted the glyphosate license renewal for a period less than five years essentially out of countries in the eu wanted the herbicide at least in the short runthe eu with strong regulatory measures and human toxicological and environmental concerns still gave the green light to use the herbicide to ensure their agriculture progresses and the continued food security of member nations in contrast sri lanka without any reliance on even a fraction of scientific data available has banned a timetested product without even pausing to propose an effective alternative instead based on a hypothetical argument we have compromised our food security and national economy it is high time that we reverse the decision taken instead of banning the product government should have promoted using it judiciously wisely and in accordance with recommended dosages application techniques and timingusing alternativeswe need effective alternatives for herbicides and we have been using alternate techniques where possibleflooding lowland paddy fields is considered as an effective ageold technique to control weeds by reducing their competition with the crop and negative impact on crop yield however lack of adequate water in a changing climate still causes problems to the farming community manual weeding or use simple implements such as mammoties and grass cutters are alternatives provided that the economic benefits are assuredthe situation is different with respect to other crops for example maize and tea both being upland crops and grown in different terrains with no options for water logging the upland crops are sensitive to stagnant water more labour intensive technologies are the only option thus affecting the economic returns from crop cultivation mulching may work out to be a viable option to control weeds provided that large quantities of the materials are made available overall practical application of available alternatives has not yielded the expected results except for some locations including small scale agriculture scientists are still working out and need time to come up with viable alternatives that provide effective weed control minimized nontarget effects and required economic gainshaving a birdseye viewwe have failed to look at issues taking the totality into consideration the complex problems in agriculture have no single and simple answers especially with regard to national level food security forces with political and spiritual ideologies have always succeeded in the recent past in overruling even the most basic scientific principles this is a pathetic story we have to analyze our production systems in concert with our food security in order to ensure that our growing population will be fed overcoming hunger without depending on food supplies from neighboring countries food security is a national security issue that cannot be ignoredhence any policy that negatively affects national food security should never be tolerated as it will without a doubt lead sri lanka into becoming a food beggar nation our policy makers must follow science andmake evidencebased decisions considering the bigpicture rather than focusing on oneend of the problem scientists too need to support the policy makers by being open and providing conclusive and scientifically valid datato facilitate decision making however they have to be careful not to bombard decision makers with halfbaked information or information based on whims and fancies of a select few especially where the outcome is potentially disastrous our country has already experienced the negative impacts of the lattermisinformation is worse than not providing any information at all to the public and policy makers unfortunately many seek to grow influence by stoking unnecessary and oftentimes irrational fear among the general public on incidentssubstances without any scientific evidence this has now become a common method to rally people to achieve unscrupulous political or personal motives and i believe our most pressing concern is now to ensure that such tactics are dispensed with science and rationality must prevailthe ban on glyphosate has been imposed without scientific evidence the recent claim that we need to go by the precautionary principle itself proves that the original decision to ban the product made in hypothesizing that the chemical causes ckdu is baseless three years have lapsed since this erroneous decision was made and in that time the agriculture sector has taken the brunt of this disastrous policy climate change further exacerbates these dynamics weeds tend to thrive and compete vigorously with crops when resources are limited that is their nature we need to understand this behavior to make sure the crops survive and the country reap richer harvests regular challenges continue to be made to those who support the ban to clearly state their justification with scientific evidence and to date none have stepped forward hence there is no necessity for new reasons interestingly many who supported the ban also claimpublicly that glyphosatebased productsare imported illegally and are available freely in the country this is yet another reason for lifting the ban previously we have been bringing in pesticides under stringent government control through the registrar of pesticides rop who operates as per the pesticides control act no as amended of we have now blocked the entry of qualityassured glyphosate to the country but opened up avenues to crooked businessmen to bring in products illegally with no quality control just

driversmarketleading position dialog s standalone credit profile of aaalka is underpinned by its market leadership in the growing mobile and paytv industry segments we believe the company is in a position to gain revenue market share from smaller telcos with its superior g g networks capability it has a solid financial profile with a revenue growth of stable operating ebitdar margin of around and low fitchforecast ffo adjusted net leverage of xhigh ratings headroom we believe dialog would receive support from its parent axiata group berhad axiata of malaysia if its standalone credit profile were to weaken dialog and its parent continue to have moderate linkages which include sharing key management personnel a common name and common creditors which could result in reputational risk to axiata should dialog failunaffected by ctf acquisition dialog s rating is unaffected by the acquisition of colombo trust finance plc ctf a small nonbank financial institution for lkr billion completed in november dialog is likely to use it to expand its digital financial services strategy and supplement its payment settlement platform dialog is likely to infuse equity of lkr billion in ctf during in order to meet an enhanced minimum regulatory capital requirement of lkr billion by january ctf s capital structure should then be strong enough to prevent becoming a cash drain on dialog over the rating horizonwe have fully deconsolidated ctf s debt which is mainly in the form of deposits and ebitda from dialog in our analysisproposed taxes credit negative fitch believes that dialog s operating ebitdar margin could narrow to and its ffo adjusted net leverage could deteriorate to x x x if it were to pay an additional lkr billion billion taxes for its mobile towers as proposed by the government however we believe there is a high level of uncertainty about the implementation of the taxes and we have not therefore factored these into our base case nevertheless we would expect dialog s ratings to remain unaffected even if the taxes were implemented given the high ratings headroomthe sri lankan government s budget announced on november proposes to tax mobile operators lkr per tower each monthhighsingledigit revenue growth we expect dialog s revenue to grow by during driven by data services revenue growth of and supported by the removal of the telco levy on data services in september we believe that data services revenue contribution to consolidated revenue will rise to over in stable profitability barring proposed tower taxes we forecast dialog s operating ebitdar margin to remain stable around as larger economies of scale in the data segment will support falling profitability on the voice and text segments strong data growth is supported by the proliferation of smartphones with over half of new smartphones activated on dialog s network being genablednegative fcf on large capex we forecast a small free cash flow fcf deficit during as cash flow from operations will fall short of dialog s large ongoing capex plan and dividend commitments the company will continue to invest about of its revenue in capex each year to expand its g networks and its optical fibre infrastructure we expect dividends to increase to around lkr billionlkr billion lkr billion during debtfunded ma some industry consolidation is likely with ongoing intense competition in the mobile segment where smaller telcos are unprofitable and face high investment requirements we believe dialog and sri lanka telecom plc slt baaalkastable could acquire smaller telcos to strengthen their market position and consolidate spectrum assets dialog s ratings have sufficient headroom for a debtfunded acquisition of a smaller telco for around lkr billion billionderivation summarydialog s business risk profile is stronger than that of similarly rated national peers given its marketleading position in sri lanka s mobile industry stable cash generation and integrated service offerings dialog has a larger revenue base and better operating ebitdar margin than the fixedline market leader slt but this is offset by dialog s higher exposure to the crowded mobile marketdialog has a larger

apr lb sri lanka s central bank has decided to reduce the standing lending facility rate slfr which is the upper bound of the policy interest rate corridor of the central bank by basis points a statement saidthe monetary board was of the view that the favourable developments in the economy warrant a reduction in policy interest rates of the central bank in particular the favourable developments in inflation inflation outlook and the trends in the monetary sector along with the lacklustre performance in economic growth were viewed as factors supporting some relaxation of the monetary policy stance in the meantime risks arising from global economic developments and the domestic fiscal front were identified as factors that need to be closely monitored going forward the statement addedthe full statement follows considering the favourable developments in inflation and inflation outlook as well as lower than expected real gdp growth that further widened the prevailing gap between actual and potential gdp growth the monetary board at its meeting held on april decided to reduce the standing lending facility rate slfr which is the upper bound of the policy interest rate corridor of the central bank by basis points this decision is also expected to dampen the volatility observed in interest rates in the domestic market during the recent pastthe monetary board s decision to reduce the slfr was based on the following macroeconomic developmentsaccording to the provisional estimates of the department of census and statistics dcs the growth performance of the sri lankan economy in was subpar having recorded a growth of per cent yearonyear compared to the growth of per cent yearonyear in while the central bank s monetary policy easing measure is expected to address the near term tepid growth prospects it is essential that the planned structural reforms are carried out without delay for the economy to move towards a sustained high growth path in the medium termthe continued slowdown in food inflation alongside the favourable base effect caused headline inflation based on the colombo consumer price index ccpi to decelerate further in march during the first two months of a similar downward movement has been observed in national consumer price index ncpi based inflation as well responding to the tight monetary policy stance core inflation remained belowmidsingle digit levels while inflation expectations remain anchored in keeping with these developments headline inflation is projected to be within the targeted levels during even after accounting for the impact on inflation from possible administered price adjustments in the near termon the external front in january export performance improved both in terms of price and volume which however was outpaced by the increase in imports thus causing a widening of the trade deficit nevertheless improved foreign exchange inflows in the form of earnings from tourism as well as workers remittances helped cushion the impact on the current account to some extent supported by the moderation in inflation during the first quarter of and the gradual depreciation in the nominal exchange rate the real effective exchange rate reer indices recorded a gradual adjustment thereby augmenting the country s competitiveness improved competitiveness under the flexible exchange rate regime would help reduce the external current account deficit in the future so far during the year the central bank has been able to purchase over us dollars million from the domestic foreign exchange market to build up international reserves in addition to the net foreign exchange purchases of us dollars million in thus improving the nonborrowed portion of external official reserves and reducing the vulnerability to external shocksfiscal slippages in spite of the government s efforts towards consolidation caused the overall fiscal deficit to deviate from its envisaged path in however notable improvements were observed in tax revenue collection and current expenditure helping the government to record a primary surplus and a moderation in the debt to gdp ratio in the implementation of the inland revenue act ira with effect from april along with other reforms to improve revenue administration are likely to support fiscal performance in the period aheadin the monetary sector in spite of the increase in credit to the public sector by banks the growth of both broad money supply and credit extended to the private sector remained subdued during the first two months of most market interest rates have stabilised at high levels while real interest rates indicated an upward trend with declining inflation however an undue increase in short term market interest rates was observed recently requiring the central bank to take corrective operational measures to address such volatilitythe monetary board was of the view that the above developments warrant a reduction in policy interest rates of the central bank in particular the favourable developments in inflation inflation outlook and the trends in the monetary sector along with the lacklustre performance in economic growth were viewed as factors supporting some relaxation of the monetary policy stance in the meantime risks arising from global economic developments and the domestic fiscal front were identified as factors that need to be closely monitored going forward with this decision of the monetary board to reduce the standing lending facility rate slfr of the central bank by basis points slfr will be at per cent while the standing deposit facility rate sdfr will remain unchanged at per cent the narrower policy rate corridor will also help the central bank to maintain short term interest rates at

blue ocean group of companiesblue ocean group of companies has grown into a versatile conglomerate over the years the evolution of the group is significant because the group has achieved growth and profit harmoniously and not by taking part in the aggressive competition in the field blue ocean group of companies engage in real estate construction engineering trading education travels and holidays entertainment consultation and many other fieldsare customers purchasing apartments or condominiums purely as an investment or do they actually plan to live therewe have identified three types of customers generally in the market and this segment includes the customers who want to buy apartments purely as an investment then those who want to buy an apartment as a holiday home especially the expats living abroad and then finally customers who simply desire luxurious livingit s all about location location and location they say in real estate and standing by this philosophy we have placed our projects in key areas of the country which has a direct link towards influencing the purchase intention of our customerslocation is especially a significant sales factor for those who wish to reside in the apartments and call it their home and true to the location factor advantage our projects have majority of our properties have been purchased by those who wish to reside in them and call it their home other aspects a customer may ponder prior to a sales decision include factors such as the design functionality facilities offered reputation and the quality of the previously completed apartment projects all of which is above the standard requirements expected in the industry as it is one of our promises to always exceed customer expectations to achieve the dream luxury living they seek a reality sometimes in order to achieve this we have to even customize standard condominiums into specific requirements of the customersis there adequate demand to justify the boom in apartment construction especially in the luxury segment we are quite aware that many without prior experience or knowledge in the industry have made baseless predictions as to there will be a drop in demand or claiming that the market will reach its point of saturation soonhowever this is an exaggerated claim far above the truth as we are quite aware as a market leader about the behavioural aspects of this housing marketmany of the sri lankan nationals who left the country previously during the civil war and having lived overseas until now in europe australia canada and usa have begun returning to their country of birth seeking an abode for retirement which also will provide them with a sense of belonging and the opportunity to be amongst family and friends further our conducive climate in comparison to the countries mentioned above and the religious cultural traditions makes them reminisce the yester yearsas a result vast numbers of expats are looking to buy apartments for both investment and accommodation purposes since of late purchase of condominiums in sri lanka by high networth expats has seen an exponential growthaccurate research by those who intend to purchase property here would indicate that the prices of apartment buildings in our country continue to be attractive when compared with other property prices in europe hong kong or even chinathe government s commendable decision to grant a temporary residence visa for a period of two years extendable on expiry under the dream home policy has encouraged many retired expatriates who are looking to migrate to warmer countries to consider investing a stipulated amount of money towards purchasing property in our country similar visa facilities and schemes have helped countries such as malaysia and dubai to successfully attract pensioners and retireeshowever it must also be stated that despite the government s decision to go ahead with such schemes the implementation of such policies and processes have been rather slow to be adopted by the relevant authorities due to the lack of clarity in themhow can we look towards attracting more people to settle in our countryone positive way in which this could be achieved is by promoting sri lanka as a destination for higher education and learning by being a lecturer myself i know that our standards of education and coaching methods through our simplified learning methods could be compared with the best in this regionwe have in our country several reputed colleges and private universities which could easily be regarded as part of such a plan to attract international students this would ideally bring in much valued foreign exchange and an automatic requirement for dwelling spaces for students and their guardianssri lanka also has extreme potential to attract those seeking medical treatment in our region such as patients who travel to india to visit our own country towards obtaining the same we definitely have the necessary infrastructure to act as a medical hub for the region while considering the number of private hospitals which are efficient and the doctors who are available here for consultationour hospitals and treatment centres do not lack advanced equipment and we already have patients from other countries staying over for prolonged treatment procedures through our centuries old native treatment and remedythe immigration department already offers visa for those obtaining medical treatment and this as mentioned previously would ideally enhance the requirement for long term lodging solutions the government authorities should clearly take adequate steps to promote this concept due to its immense potential while considering that even those patients who seek medical treatment for simple illnesses at the nhs in the united kingdom are required to stand in long queuesdoes our public utility systems such as the provision of water electricity and telecommunications have the capacity to cater to the entire number of high rise residential complexesthis question contradicts what we spoke of earlier where we discussed a lack of buyers for the completed high rise housing complexes as we now discuss the ability to accommodate the extra demand for utilities through economies of scale the government owned public loss making utility companies could actually begin to generate profits by their supply of such utilities to apartment buildingsthe government is capable of expanding the service of its utility companies to provide the entire requirement but needs to plan out its strategy in the long term to ensure continuity without a frequent breakdown in servicesin which parts of the country do you see the most growth in terms of real estate and whydespite what has been mentioned in the media we developers continue to maintain a cordial business relationship through which we discuss new project locations amicably and avoid treading on each other s toeshowever colombo will remain as the primary location for dwelling when you consider how well the city is established with its government departments schools hotels places of worship proximity to the airport entertainment locations etcit is said that your group has been recognized as the leading construction company in the country could you please tell us about these credentialsour group earned the prestigious sri lanka s best developer award at asia property awards organized by property guru asia in singapore in along with other awards for best interior design best condo architecture design and best sustainable developmentin addition in january we bagged the asia s greatest brands and leaders award this event was organized by the asia one magazine and united research services urs and the entire process underwent the strict review of the renowned price waterhouse coopers pwcthe competition was among asia s greatest brands their leaders from leading industries sub industries in asian countries hence blue ocean s victory is not only a recognition for its excellence but also an international recognition for its motherland sri lanka toohowever in my opinion the great trust our customers had kept in us is the best asset we have earned so far and the peaceful life they lead in our apartments is the best award we could expectwhat would you say are the latest trendsinnovations in the real estate spacedespite the possibility of using new methods of construction such as precast concrete and steel structures which affords speedy construction at blue ocean we have stuck to our time tested methods of building through the use of bricks which reduces the heat and allows the building to remain cool withinour award winning architecture new styles and designs continue to be recognised even in european countrieshow intense is market competition and what strategies do you employ to stay ahead as our company s name suggests competition is irrelevant to blue ocean for we follow the blue ocean concept and as we continue to innovate through our own style of quality construction and have created a great demand for our housing projects and despite the presence of approximately chinese and other developers the demand and sales of our apartments have never been higher which clearly indicates growthyour opinion about the present and future status of real estate industry in sri lankaat present the trend is quite satisfactory and there is still a lot of room for growth i am happy to say that the market is sound well and fundamentally driven we see no impending issues as sri lanka sails forth towards unprecedented development real estate sector has become ever so significant as the backbone of the country s economysri lanka s real estate industry is driven

april lbo in a recent speech in parliament jo mp tharaka balasuriya highlighted some problematic technicalities in the active liability management billthe bill has encountered some controversy with the supreme court finally having to weigh in through a verdict confirming that the bill is in fact constitutionalbalasuriya highlighted that this is indeed a very powerful bill the bill allows the minister in charge to raise up to percent of country s total outstanding debt through parliament these funds can only be used for refinancing and prefinancing of existing loans he states that as the total debt outstanding is rs trillion the mechanism can be used to raise up to rs trillionthe jo mp does think that an active liability management bill is a necessity due to the debt related problems about to emerge in sri lankahe goes on to state the objective of this act as stated is to manage public debt to ensure the financing needs and payment obligations of the government are met at the lowest possible cost this bill also provides tremendous power to an individual in this case the minister in charge of the central bank who is empowered to decide on the quantum of the loan and the mode of raising such a loan section of this bill somewhat checks this power stating that the minister can obtain loans only with the approval of the cabinet of ministers balasuriya complains that as the quantum of the loans can be massive a direct reference should be made in the act itself to the monetary board and that these matters are best handled through the public debt departmentthe jo mp then went on to complain about the prime minister having too much power in this liability management process as the central bank is under this ministry shortly after this speech the president took action to gazette the central bank back under the finance ministrybalasuriya states i have no problem with the prime minister except for his track record now this house wants to give this man the power to raise percent of our national debt or roughly rs one trillion in any manner he sees best in any event mr speaker even if it was not the prime minister at the helm of the central bank i am sure we can all agree that more safeguards need to be brought in if the government is not willing to make the necessary amendments then we must remind maithripala sirisena that he is indeed the president and in matters such as this it is better to be proactive and prevent large scale malpractices from taking place rather than reading about them in newspapers balasuriya is a signatory to the noconfidence motion against the prime minister to be taken up on april th

apr lbo no matter how successful companies are today they may risk extinction if they fail to invest in their employees and won t transform with changing times head of hcm cloud applications asia pacific at oracle corporation yazad dalal recently warned companies and business leadershe advised companies to invest in the people functions and to focus more on modernizing human resource within an organisation in reality the values of companies are largely lodged in your people so the way we treat them and interact with them is going to be increasingly important he told the slasscom people summit dalal who is responsible for strategy operations and overall growth of oracle s human capital management cloud solutions across the asia pacific region emphasized that people are a company s primary intellectual property and therefore it becomes incredibly important that organisations invest more in them if they wish to not go extinct which is no more a farfetched concept for companies no matter how successful they are todayhe recalled how at least percent of companies listed in the new york stock exchange that was successful years ago no longer exist that seems logical as it was years ago but what is surprising is that from the fortune global companies in the year only a certain percent exist now so extinction is definitely a reality and possibility for all of us dalal told his audience which comprised of business leaders and hr professionals representing the itbpm industrydalal pointed out that profits and strong business outcomes will be achieved based on the experience that organisations provide their employees we must provide our employees an enjoyable experience and for this we must built human centered systems and processors that offer employees an enjoyable experience he saidhe also highlighted that when investing in employees an organisation should not only invest in their white collar professionals but instead they must invest on all its employees including the lady who plucks tea at as well as the person who handles the textile machine they are all people and they should be treated the same he said while adding that investing in its employees also empowers themdalal who possess nearly two decades experience working in the human capital space said that emerging technologies are creating new opportunities and technologies such as artificial intelligence autonomous software internet of things iot and human interface have been identified as the way forward industries are changing at an unprecedented rate with new entrants and new business models and this has resulted in customer expectations increasing and also changing dramatically everyone in this room works at an organisation that might not exist in five years because no industry is immune and it doesn t matter if you re providing a professional service in technology tea or power but the good news is that as technology advances it also creates new opportunities dalal saidamidst increasing concerns of the possibility of robots replacing the jobs of people dalal was quick to assure that while robots can be knowns for their efficiently it doesn t mean that they can take over every capability that a human is known forto further elaborate his point dalal showed a picture of a robot in an operating theatre conducting a surgery at a hospital in singapore but while the robot is doing the surgery it is the doctor and the nurse who are guiding it to carry out the surgery he said while adding that even though the robot was carrying out the surgery it didn t mean that neither the doctor nor the nurse lost their job the doctor and nurse have adopted with time and they have adapted to a new and different way of applying their knowledge and skill set dalal pointedhe also said that while robots are good for productivity what they are not good for at least for the moment is how to think or even dream which are important words for innovation humans are good at thinking dreaming and no robot can ever replace that he saiddalal said that mankind s intelligence can be best manifested when it can combine its own intelligence with machines they are not going to be our lords and we are not going to smash them up like in some scifi movie nor will our demand diminish because of robots instead we will have a renewed sense for a renewed purpose and we will work together with these amazing innovations than against them he addedspeaking on the importance of transforming a company by using technology dalal said by computerizing certain hr related application filling process against the age old manual filling applications process at his company oracle helped them in successfully saving man yearselaborating on his claim dalal said sometime back when a new employee was recruited to his he or she had to go through the process of going to the hr department and filling various forms on their first day at work which takes around two hoursinstead his company computerized this process by sending the letter of appointment and when the selected candidate clicks i accept and then they are directed to a page where they can electronically fill in all the relevant forms online before they start work this is what efficiency should be like he saiddalal noted that it was increasingly important to focus on using technology which can in turn make the employee s life better and even help him or her to enjoy the work they do at office while also promoting a better professional output from them the same way we can friend and unfriend someone on facebook why can t we promote someone at office with just two clicks this technology exists and we must use it he saiddalal also said that employees should be able to apply for leave the same way they check in at a restaurant from their mobile phone these shouldn t be felt as a transaction instead they should be an interaction with the company we must respect our employees and give them an enjoyable experience at the work place he reiterateddalal disclosed that today there were several companies where its employees used the voice technology to send out emails and text messages even though only a few are using this technology at the moment in time everyone from every company will demand this technology but the longer we take to transform and change thesoonerour employees are going to leave he warned the way we transform the way we think and connect and work will eventually result in how successful our organisations will be dalal addedthe people summit organised by slasscom which was held for the seventh time this year revolved around the theme transforming the way we think work and connect the summit brought together over business leaders and hr professionals

 outlook stable fitch ratings has affirmed sri lankabased conglomerate hemas holdings plc s hemas national longterm rating at aalka with a stable outlook fitch has also affirmed the national rating on hemas s outstanding senior unsecured debentures at aalka hemas s rating reflects fitch s view that the group s business risk profile has improved from the acquisition of atlas axillia private limited atlas the largest domestic manufacturer and distributor of exercise books pens colour products and other school stationery early this year however the benefits are offset to an extent by the operational pressures in its fast moving consumer goods fmcg segment that accounted for of ebitda in the financial year ended march fy and its leisure business which we expect to persist in the next months the affirmation takes into account fitch s view that significant expansion plans in the next couple of years could limit further improvements in hemas s leverage defined as adjusted debtoperating ebitdar fy x as internally generated funds may not be sufficient to fully fund planned capex and shareholder returnskey rating driversatlas boosts defensive cash flows we expect hemas s lkr billion atlas acquisition to improve cash flow stability as the latter s business is defensive across economic cycles fitch expects demand for school stationery to grow over the medium term supported by government and privatesector investments in the education sector and rising per capita income in the country we believe this acquisition is in line with hemas s strategy of using its significant cash balance to expand its core businesses through maatlas s stationery business fits into hemas s fmcg segment and atlas will be able to leverage on hemas s established distribution network once the integration is completed we expect atlas to contribute around and to group revenue and ebit respectively in fy its first year of full consolidationexpansion limits leverage improvement we do not expect hemas to engage in any other large scale ma that is similar to atlas in the medium term but the company will continue to spend lkr billion billion on organic expansion in its core segments in the next few years we estimate hemas will generate around lkr billion per annum in cash flow from operations in the next few years but this may be insufficient to fully cover the planned capex and shareholder returns we do not expect an improvement in company leverage in the medium term amid higher borrowings and a moderating operating performancefmcg pressures we expect the fmcg segment slowdown to continue in the next months due to pressures in bangladesh around of fmcg revenue in fy arising from the restructuring of hemas s distribution network and increased competition bangladesh was the segment s growth driver in the last three years with revenue cagr of over but we expect the growth to materially decelerate in the near term as the company s moves to resolve the issues may take time we believe hemas may have to keep investing in its bangladesh distribution network and marketing efforts to support its bigger operational scale and counter competition which would keep margins below historical levels in the medium termwe don t expect a recovery in domestic fmcg volumes in the near term as weak personal income and inflationary pressures may force consumers to continue to cut down on personal and home care spending domestic margins may also remain pressured due to a pickup in input costs and currency depreciation which the company may find difficult to fully pass on to customers amid weak demand however steps taken by the company to streamline its supply chain operations are likely to generate cost savings to offset margin pressure to an extent hemas s fmcg revenue was flat yoy in mfy while ebit margin contracted bp over the same periodleisure slowdown to persist we expect hemas s hotel around of leisure sector ebit performance to continue to weaken in the medium term on declining occupancy and room revenue due to a slowdown in tourist arrivals oversupply of graded accommodation and competition from the informal sector hemas s hotel sector revenue was flat in mfy while ebit margins contracted almost percentage points yoyhealthcare stability we believe the healthcare segment can offset most of the other segments earnings volatility we expect the drug distribution arm to continue winning market share from distributors exiting the market on price regulations primarily on branded drugs hemas which focuses on generic drugs saw its market share rising to in fy in fy due to the lack of branded drugs in the market and acquisition of competitor brands we expect the pharma segment and its hospital chain to continue

by kithmina hewage harini weerasekeraeconomic reforms have become an urgent need for sri lanka with successive governments since independence resorting to shortterm politically expedient economic strategies that have placed considerable macroeconomic pressures whilst reducing sri lanka s global competitiveness vision the current government s short and mediumterm policy direction is aimed atsteeringthe economy towards more sustainable means of growthled by foreign and domestic private investment the successful implementation of economic reforms however depends heavily on a combination of political institutional and socioeconomic factors in fact institutional misalignment misidentified reforms and data deficiencies were identified as key structural and institutional bottlenecks hampering the successful implementation of vision at the new thinkers symposium a unique platform launched by ips for those under the age of from the public sector private sector academia thinktanks and other fields of interest involved in economic affairsinstitutional misalignmentthe most severe impediment to national economic policy implementation is the complex institutional framework within sri lanka s public sector which lacks coordination and capacity and is worryingly bloated the sector is made up of too many workers who are engaged in duplicative work while being subject to constant shifts in ministerial portfolios a recipe for inaction of any national economic action plan institutional excess in sri lanka s public sector is giving rise to institutional fragmentation and instability which is ultimately the primary hindrance to implementation of any reform agenda policy roadmaps such as vision which have undergone a consultative process to include inputs of relevant stakeholders are likely to be futile in the absence of a stable institutional setup to implement the mapped out reforms a snapshot view of institutional excess can be seen in figure too many ministries agencies and departments result in overlapping functions and mandates which leads to institutional fragmentation furthermore the level of institutional instability in sri lanka can be illustrated with the case of the department of project management and monitoring department for vision which experienced three changes in its overlooking ministry in the space of three yearsanother crucial area in need of reformshampered by institutional complexity is the stateowned enterprisessoe sector multiple stakeholder contestations take place on soe reforms due to the decentralization of soe oversight which slows and complicates the reform processgiven that unstable and bloated public institutions are often a reality that developing economies must contend with a more practical approach suggested would be to adopt clusters of core subjects areasthat group together multiple ministerial portfolios belonging to the same core subject area under such a framework clusters should coordinate closely to avoid duplicating mandates the current adhoc division of ministerial portfolios creates conflicts of interest whilst also hindering the scope of policy consistency and continuitymisidentified reformseconomic reforms are often spread over a significant amount of time and require considerable sequencing in this regard it is vital that the government undertakes reforms that are most impactful on the economywhile taking into account low hanging fruit for instance when considering the impact of information communication technology ict on the economy policies to enable flexible working conditions facilitated by ict and improved online payment mechanisms can have a much larger marginal benefit to the economy than the significant investment cost of providing free wifi to the public for instance internet usage is low in sri lanka amidst relatively affordable and higher internet speeds compared to other countries in the region similarly on education reforms low levels of tertiary enrolment in stem science technology engineering mathematics subjects has a knock on effect on the economy with only of the population above the age of engaged in science and technology related education and employment given the current challenges regarding broad economic reforms the government should concentrate on prioritizing policies that have wide public and bipartisan support such as accommodating flexible officehours and less rigid working conditionsdeficient data accessibilitysuccessful reform identification proposal and implementation depend heavily on evidencebased policymaking therefore deficiencies in data accessibility are a leading obstacle to good policy research in sri lanka and ultimately to its capacity to influence policy reform this is a composite problem due to obscure governance structures and poor access to official data and information the problem affects the research community and university studentsalikeusing facilities like the right to information rti act has led to some improvements however verite research finds that nearly of public authorities are moderately unsatisfactory in their proactive disclosure of information and only moderately satisfactory with regards to the samethis issue links back to poor public service delivery under a highly complex institutional setup making the accessing of datasets time consuming or impossibleconclusion unfortunately sri lanka s history of economic policy reforms has often been defined by its shortterm naturedespite the necessity for longlasting economic reforms heightening in recent years regardless of political affiliation the country s economic future will be determined by responsible policymaking over the next few years that address structural and institutional weaknesses while political will is important to successfully implement these reforms and the appetite for reforms has waned recently there is significant scope for reforms with little to no political costs even these reforms however are likely to be undermined by bottlenecks discussed above unless the government takes decisive stepsto mitigate themkithmina hewage is a research officer

by jekhan aruliahthe british author charles dickens created a character mrmicawber who was permanently in debt translated into a sri lankan context micawber famously made the point daily income rs daily expenditure rs result happiness daily income rs daily expenditure rs result misery simply put micawber said if your income is more than your expenditure then you will be happy but if you spend more than you earn you will be miserable in reality life isn t so simple many people with oodles of spare cash are extravagantly miserable but let s put that fact asidelivelihood building initiatives for poor communities often run by ngos and charities tend to focus on increasing incomes however in much of our country the available income generation opportunities are miserly and are demeaning for many options to earn money are limited to selling their labour for a low price or their bodies for even lessa much overlooked solution to the micawber conundrum instead of increasing income is reducing expenditure this article comes out of conversations with revjoshua sivagnanam a christian priest who has worked for many years tending to the economic and spiritual needs of the population of the kilinochchi and mullaitivu districts in the northern provincedistricts which according to data from the sri lanka government s department of census and statistics are the poorest in our nationthe graph shows the median household income which means half of families are living on less than this some on far lessrev joshua s wisdom is directed principally at the rural communities scratching a living from an acre or two of farmland but perhaps he has lessons for the increasing number in colombo squeezing themselves into ever smaller and ever more expensive condominiums even if you don t have room to swing a bag of manioc in your condokitchen there are things to be learned from rev joshua that may make your urban lives just a little bit less miserable the manioc in that bag you can t swing has delicious nutritious treasures hidden in plain sight that you may be unwittingly throwing into the garbagerev joshua laments that women from rural areas who work long hours in a factory earning rs a month take all that money to the local shop to buy food they could instead source for free from their own land when they walk through their acre of land from their home to the shop they unknowingly step over many vegetables that would make tasty and nutritious meals for their families even the vegetables they do pluck have delicious parts perhaps the leaves or the roots or the bark that are cut off and thrown away with a bit of traditional knowledge their families could eat more from their own land and keep more of their hard earned rupees in their pocketsrev joshua rj was born in kegalle kilometres from kandy as an eight year old child in his was one of many tamil families who fled kegalle in the early stages of the sri lankan civil war his family both parents with four sisters and himself lived on the poverty line even before they fled their home the government sent them to the jungles of killinochchi where the land was wild with trees and bushes families were left to clear the land themselves at a time when there were hardly any ngos or any other support for the displaced people when they arrived there was nothing no shelter no toilet facilities no water no food they had to provide everything for themselvesthese internally displaced persons idps built themselves shelter making walls and roofs from the mud and clay of the ground and from tree branches they foraged food from the leaves and the vegetables they found in the junglerj said we had big challenges due to the wild elephants and many people were killed due to them but we had no option to move anywhere else the families worked together to shout and make noise to chase away the elephants i couldn t forget that at that time to clear land we cut the trees and bushes and burned the stubble then after the night rains the very next morning we could see small mushrooms growing from the ashes the children went to school leaving home without any food in their stomachs however by the time they reached the school their stomachs would be full of the fruits and food they found on the wayjanuary to december every month there were different foods that were ready to eat again at the end of school the children would eat lunch by foraging on the way home at that time we had no health problems malaria was a big problem in sri lanka but we idp children seemed to be immune for some reason i think due to the diet only in the evening did we have a cooked meal at home my mother and sisters would go to the paddy fields to collect dropped grains of rice and forage for wild vegetables for my mother to cook my father got labouring work in killinochchi and was paid rs per month my mother looked after the family me and my four sisters as well as my father and herself on rs per month saving rs each month she very rarely went to the market except for rice and salt and clotheseverything else we got from nature and we were very healthy rj said his father is now and his mother is they have had no major diseases in their lifetimes no heart problem no diabetes no blood pressure no cholesterol rj believes this is mainly due to their dietsrj commented that there were three phases of his life childhood as an idp as a theological student as a christian minister he went on to say in my christian ministry i applied my childhood experience of displacement and hunger together with my theological studies when i dedicated myself to the christian ministry i saw my past life experience through the christian theology when jesus fed people in the wilderness people believe he got the food from heaven but i believe he fed the people by showing them where to find food grown naturally in the ground rj stated that in times of disaster whether natural or manmade bodies like the united nations respond by flying in food he said the victims of the disaster can also fulfil their needs by looking for the food in their own natural environmentrj commented during the troubles particularly to there was a big challenge for food because the government banned transport of many food items to the north but in that time there was no death by starvation because the people had learned to live within the natural environment he said of the displaced families we replaced rice with the lotus root some lotus plants have seeds which can be used instead of riceevery morning families would go to the small ponds and would get lotus roots which became lunch and dinner this strengthened the people s immune system the lotus is the most important flower in the asian culture both buddhists and hindus revere the lotus flower for religious reasons the lotus saved us refugees from starvation since the end of the civil war rj sees his responsibility in life has changed now after and the end of the war a lot of people still feel they are poor many organisations have done a lot of work to help the region we have housing water jobs we have food in the shops but the people are still poor because they have no spare cash the money they earn is spent buying food in the market now i want to change the people s attitude so they no longer seek charity to survive this is a problem of the whole community not an individual problem the community is looking for outside help without looking at the strength they have themselves they blame others for having no food no rights no political solution no economic opportunitythey believe someone else oppresses us but they don t look for what they can do for themselves i want to remove this blindfold from the community during the troubles rj said all the families shared what they found they shared information on where these things could be found since the end of the war the community has forgotten how to do thisi asked rj to tell me of some forgotten foods these are often the discarded parts of popular vegetables as he gives examples rj emphasises that he doesn t want these foods to be considered medicinal herbs or special items for occasional use but staple everyday foodslotus root can be boiled with salt and can be eaten like manioc it can be fried boiled or curried seed can be boiled and eaten like rice flowers can be cooked like cabbage banana stump the tender core can be made into curries mixed with flour to make pittu and rotis it can be used in stir fries manioc leaves can be used in stir fries they can be pounded and mixed with flour to make bread rotis pittu ridge gourd can be made into curries and used in stir fries papaya the unripe fruit can be grated and used in stir fries it can be added to flour to make bread and pittu it can be chopped into small pieces like potatos and made into curries kasini leaves also known as gogu easily found in the jungle you should grind the leaves and add it to curries to thicken the sauce like tomato puree this has a good flavour and provides energyrj emphasised that although he gets vegetables from his garden they grow naturally without his help i get my vegetables from my garden but i don t plant them there are enough just growing wild god is cultivating it without polluting pesticide or fertiliser without cultivation without artificial watering vegetables are there in the garden on the roadsides and in the jungles god is the farmer the proof of the pudding is in the eating so i travelled from jaffna with some friends to rj s home in malayalapuram a village in the killinochchi district rj is a beneficiary of the indian government s housebuilding scheme for displaced people after the war he still keeps his original mud floored home as an office for the organisation he now runs kaveri kala manram it was here he brought us to prove his claim that he could cook a good meal mostly he had purchased spices onions garlic and tomatoes with foraged food i take a free range chicken and collect one kilo of green leaves from my garden cook the meat for minutes then add the green leaves and continue cooking for minutes i have a very flavourful curry the whole dinner is this one dish my three children rush to eat this because it is very tasty chicken cut very small kovai moringa leaves thuthuvalla spinach passion fruit leaves curry leaves ponnankaniwhat did we think of rj s foraged lunch to paraphrase julius caesar we came we ate and we were conqueredmtullaitivu and killinochchi the main areas rj operates are two of he poorest districts in sri lanka the people spend almost all their money on food with no money left for health or education or to invest in their land and businessesthey have no money to do the very things that would pull them out of poverty rev joshua has encouraged the community he serves to cook with the produce of their gardens we visited a food festival he organised in a rural village preschool here the people demonstrated their cooking starting with a competition to make a soup in minutes from vegetables found in the school playground having enjoyed the various soups the cooks continued to forage and boil and stir over open fires an hour later they put on a splendid vegetarian buffeti myself am no stranger to colombo s star hotel buffets i can say with confidence dish for dish these rural cooks with their foraged ingredients were better the serving trays weren t made of polished steel the plates weren t the best bone china the tables weren t covered with fine linen the floors weren t of imported marble but the taste the textureand the colours of the food were better the writer jekhan aruliah was born in sri lanka and moved with his family to the uk when he was two years of age

mar lbo sri lanka perhaps provides the most cautionary tale from their asiapacific markets about overreliance on chinabacked infrastructure development a research firm saidin a blog post about asiapacific s road to economic prosperity asia regional editor of oxford business group patrick cooke said chinese acquisitions from other countries make emerging nations in the belt and road initiative bri crosshairs nervousat the close of last year sri lanka formally handed over percent control of hambantota port to chinese interests on a year lease it is a result of being unable to service the loans from chinese statecontrolled entities it acquired to build the billion dollars maritime complex cooke said chinese acquisition of equity in strategic assets from countries unable to honour their debt commitments is understandably making other emerging nations in the bri crosshairs nervous cooke said so far the us and allied regional powers such as japan india and australia have failed to muster a coherent response to the bri with opinions divided on whether to counter ignore or embrace the chinaled modelhowever for it to be a road to prosperity rather than a belt around the neck of emerging economies in asiapacific and beyond it needs to be paved with more than empty rhetoric about winwin investments he addedfull blog post is reproduced belowasiapacific s road to economic prosperity or a belt around the neckwith the belt and road initiative bri now firmly enshrined in the chinese communist party constitution it is safe to assume that this flagship project of president xi jinping will continue long after the country s most powerful leader since chairman mao zedong officially steps down whether that happens in or notif the execution matches the rhetoric of china s leadership this bold vision for transnational infrastructure development linking asia to europe and africa to the south pacific through land and sea corridors and industrial clusters has the potential to transform the dynamics of global trade and accelerate the pace of development across the emerging worlda wealth of opportunities for chinathe benefits for china are manifold from securing a plurality of trade routes to exporting excess manufacturing capacity and chinese industrial innovations each time the chinese government or a chinese firm inks a deal to build a rail network or communications infrastructure overseas for example they secure recurrent business for decades to come as other countries become reliant on chinese technology to upgrade and maintain their systemsfurthermore by building infrastructure that links china s underdeveloped interior provinces with the markets of eurasia asean and beyond china is able to accelerate the pace of development in its secondary and tertiary cities making it easier for companies in the hinterland to export their goods and forge crossborder trading networks the bri can also be seen as a longterm vehicle for internationalising the renminbi as a rival trading and reserve currency to the us dollarall roads lead to beijingchina likes to talk about the bri as a winwin initiative with all participating countries benefitting from integrated transnational infrastructure development certainly there can be no denying that the emerging world has daunting infrastructure gaps to fill with the asian development bank estimating that developing asia needs to invest trn per year in infrastructure through to yet sceptics question whether beijing s motives are truly benign or if the bri will in reality provide china with excessive leverage over the emerging economies of asiapacific and foster unhealthy dependence on chinese investment loans contractors and technologyothers question whether the astronomical funding requirements of the bri pose too great a debt risk to china itself with bn of projects already in the pipeline or under way according to credit ratings agency fitch although some funding for brilinked projects has already come from multilateral financial institutions and international banks have expressed growing interest the bulk of financing has come from chinese policy or commercial banks and through the stateowned silk road fundfurthermore due to the rather fluid parameters of what constitutes a bri project any bilateral chinese concessional loans for infrastructure development in the countries covered by the initiative can also be viewed as bri fundingif we can assume that a certain proportion of the chinabacked loans allotted to brilinked projects will never be fully recovered particularly from heavily indebted countries such as pakistan then it is understandable why some observers view the initiative as more of a strategic geopolitical power play than a shrewd economic endeavouron the ground we find a mixed response in the asiapacific countries where oxford business group is currently engaged in active field researchwilling partnersone of the most enthusiastic asean members for brilinked projects is thailand with the government declaring it is natural logical and mutually beneficial for its flagship bn eastern economic corridor to link up with the bri and in december construction on the highspeed rail line linking thailand with china finally got under wayover in indonesia thomas lembong chairman of the indonesia investment coordinating board told obg president joko widodo s administration is determined to make the most of our participation in this initiative to help drive investment across the economy with the government so far receiving investment pledges that cover just over half of the bn worth of road airport and rail projects in its fiveyear pipeline china is an obvious source of funding to pick up the slackhandle with care sri lanka perhaps provides the most cautionary tale from obg s active asiapacific markets about overreliance on chinabacked infrastructure development at the close of last year the country formally handed over control of hambantota port to chinese interests on a year lease as a result of being unable to service the loans from chinese statecontrolled entities it acquired to build the bn maritime complexchinese acquisition of equity in strategic assets from countries unable to honour their debt commitments is understandably making other emerging nations in the bri crosshairs nervousin myanmar a frontier market with one of the lowest gdp per capita levels in asean we have witnessed bubbling opposition to some chinabacked infrastructure projects in recent years most notably the bn myitsone dam which remains on hold due to grassroots protests against perceived chinese exploitation of myanmar s resourcesgiven its strategic location on the edges of south and southeast asia and between china s landlocked southwest and the indian ocean one hopes myanmar can leverage its geographic position to secure advantageous terms for participation in future brilinked projectsfilling the voidi happen to be writing this blog on the plane to manila from port moresby where obg has just held a roundtable event centred on the economic opportunities arising from png s chairmanship of asiapacific economic cooperation apec in png is hosting apec at a time when it faces formidable fiscal challenges due to a ballooning national debt and a chronic shortage of foreign exchangeinto the void has stepped china which has been providing opaque concessional loans to the png government for some time primarily for infrastructure investments financial assistance is now being packaged as bri funding including three memoranda of understanding signed in november for infrastructure upgrades and the development of an agriculture industrial parkjury s still out so far the us and allied regional powers such as japan india and australia have failed to muster a coherent response to the bri with opinions divided on whether to counter ignore or embrace the chinaled modelrecent reports suggest washington is considering boosting infrastructure projects across the indopacific region following a congressional hearing on policy responses to bri however the presidency of donald trump has yet to demonstrate that it has the strategic sense to effectively respond to china s longterm visions and ambitionswhile india and japan have put forward a joint initiative dubbed the asiaafrica growth corridor this is still very much in the embryonic stage and is not yet backed by the same level of political will or variety of financing vehicles as its chinese counterpartin an interview with obg in october the outgoing ceo of international enterprise singapore lee ark boon said that the biggest risk for emerging countries participating in bri projects was the creation of socalled white elephants that operate below capacity rendering them economically unviable lee proposed sensibly that the most effective way to mitigate this risk was to link infrastructure developments with longterm economic strategies focused on openness to international trade and investmentwhat is not in doubt is that the bri is here to stay however for it to be a road to prosperity rather than a belt around the neck of emerging economies in asiapacific and beyond it needs to be paved with more than empty rhetoric about winwin investments participating states must ensure their projects are well structured sustainably financed and compatible with the medium to longterm needs of their respective economies while at the same time attuned to a broader national vision for raising domestic demand and translating international investment into inclusive growth 
by jithendra antoniothe impact of big data on products and services the quality of data used in every business is more important in today s global business landscapeour world is changing at a rapid pace as organizations and societies are digitizing faster and moving online and mobile to conduct business we have more people doing their day to day shopping from home via a smartphone and cutting unnecessary costs and saving time to get involve in many other activities however whilst they are more online they indirectly generate millions of data in their day to day life that both online sellers and buyers could study to be more effective in sourcing and selling the products a recent microsoft study has pointed out that in the next five years we ll generate more data as humankind than we generated in the previous yearsso the next famous author of coming years may be the person who writes a book titled first years of data which may highlight how world was built using data as key driver of developmenthence the trend is clear in today s world consumers are moving online and shopping from the comfort of their homes while organizations are digitizing their assets rapidly to gain competitive advantage the global digitization trends have dramatically increased the power of the data and necessary steps have to be taken to manage this phenomenon organizations that capture data and make sense of it will be going ahead in the coming yearsthe number of mobileconnected devices exceeded sri lanka s population years ago and similarly the world s population after years since then in by it is forecasted that there will be billion mobileconnected devices exceeding the world s projected population at that time of billionin a virtual environment not all sources where data is derived from are created equal as such derived data itself come with unique risk security and privacy issues which should ideally have a framework in place for its governancedata governancethus organizations that harness data to gain insights of their customers will position themselves for better success in the longhaul however realizing these insights to become a data driven organization requires a disciplined approachif any of the organizations want to deliver good business results that company s data must be accurate and the use of that data must be governed through policy and monitoringdata governance is about decisionmaking management and accountability related to data in an organization often in any organization a data governance team is built to ensure data will be handled smoothly and effectively and to instill data quality data governance programs are designed to prepare rules and regulations for an organization and to handle any issues that may come up regarding data they also ensure compliance to policies they tell a corporation who the owner of the data is and who can perform certain functions with itas far is data is concerned it is evident that the strongest sector of the sri lanka s economy is the banking and financial sector a sector that boasts about several trillions of balance sheets and millions of customers banks finance companies leasing companies insurance companies and investment firms are the domestic financial services organizations that are already penetrating to mobile transactions landscape however they are yet to identify consumer behavior on their platforms to come up with effective services and products that sell faster than usual financial services are built on data whilst data governance of the industry is a critical concernthe emergence of a new normal means a need for innovation in terms of how financial institutions meet the needs of their clients thus the pace of change in the financial services industry has accelerated with disruptive technologies regulations and business models as a result asset managers in the country and across the globe have undergone a drastic change due to the advancement of disruptive technologies right now a huge wave of technology disruption is heading toward the asset servicing industry over the next few years sri lanka s financial industry too will enter into robotic process automation rpa blockchain and cognitive systems that will drive dramatic change and have a profound lasting impact on service providers operationsthe above disruptive technologies will offer enormous potential for asset servicers in creating efficiency reducing risk and improving quality of service to clients it has been suggested that automation alone could reduce headcount in the asset servicing industry by percent while also achieving a cost savings of approximately percentthe asset management sector employs approximately people worldwide many providers even domestically are still constrained by the legacy of acquisitions poor integration multiple technology platforms and a high level of customized manual activity some of the technology platforms still in widespread use date back twenty years or moreso much on stressed assets of the financial sector of the economy had been in the spotlight during recent past the quality of assets has emerged as one of the key risk factors in the sri lankan banking sector as well as the economy generally stressed assets comprise of nonperforming assets npas and restructured loans a loan whose principal andor interest remains overdue for a period days is considered as an npaprudent data governance will help asset management firms stay one step ahead of the regulators when it comes to proving the trustworthiness of their data and reducing the potential liabilities that can arise form data leakage over the past few years financial services firms have been under increasing pressure to comply with complex regulations and without data governance reporting on and complying with new regulations is a major headache therefore it is high time that sri lanka s financial services organizations put data governance in place now so you re not caught unprepared when the regulators come aroundnecessity for data protectionwith the explosive growth of data where data is doubling in size every two years a shift in to data protection paradigm is a must and vital especially based on demographics and for national reasons perhaps securing data from a country perspective is also vitalone such example is the news that came to light mid last year which highlighted that sri lanka is getting ready to create a national payment platform npp that would funnel through almost all nationwide transactions via a single platform however things turned into a uturn when reports revealed that the npp was trying to reach hands beyond the country s financial regulator central bank and it was coming into the hands of a private company that could have sold all the national payment data or consumer behavior including the privacy details of citizens to any other third party or perhaps any other country thanks to reports and vigilance and intelligence news organizations it was somehow prevented with the intervention of central bank and the relevant authoritiesthe use of data to get insights into customers buying habits to location monitoring to identify patterns or habits is now a norm another such example from recent news is strava which bills itself as the social network for athletes who has been collecting data from its users who happen to be primarily us military of their training routes imagine the threat worldwide if this data is used by terrorist and para military to target us military bases operations and locations good governance of data does not solely lie with the it but the c suit level management of an organization another case that came to light is in the recent accidental divulgence of confidential information by a leading bank in sri lanka the resulting backlash generated by the public due to it shows that even in a resilient culture such as ours in sri lanka data governance and protection of especially customer information is of absolute importancehence the chief information technology officer cio in any organization today must progress from simply aligning information technology it to its business which was the model followed to becoming the heart of the organization like the symphony of an orchestra this should be done in an effort in ensuring proper governance and aligning of it specially to ensure that its data is generated with trust utilized with care and most importantly disposed of responsiblythe writer is specialized in data

navigating a nuclearised asia for smaller states reviving sri lanka s commitments to disarmamentby malinda meegodathroughout its diplomatic history sri lanka has maintained a strong antinuclear stance given the perceived need to avoid antagonising nuclear powers in the region sri lanka has communicated this stance as a general normative and ethical position rather than by criticising individual nuclear actors recent global developments on nuclear issues however have tested the consistency of sri lanka s antinuclear stance in view of these developments and a need for consistency in its policy sri lanka should reaffirm its past commitments to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament it can advance these commitments by employing a dual track policy of working towards incremental denuclearisation in the indian ocean and by joining the growing list of nations advocating for total nuclear disarmamentsri lanka s government took seemingly contradictory positions in on north korea s nuclear programme as well as on the proposed treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons the nuclear ban treaty first it issued a statement refer notes on july condemning north korea s decision to conduct an intercontinental ballistic missile test however there were reports that the statement was not sanctioned by the president second while the government initially supported the proposed treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons the nuclear ban treaty in july it did not sign the nuclear ban treaty in september these developments indicate a lack of clarity about what the most tactical diplomatic response might be by sri lanka to the current crisis in the korean peninsula and on potential nuclear issues closer to home they signal a need for sri lanka to formulate a nuclear policy that would be pragmatic for smaller states surrounded by competing nuclear neighbours while fulfilling the country s prior commitments to promoting nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation furthermore it is important to recognise that north korea s heady approach to nuclear weapons has been influenced by the regime change of authoritarian governments in libya and iraq therefore any response from sri lanka should be undertaken with a commitment to nonintervention in sovereign statessri lanka s evolving security contextsri lanka remains a nonnuclear nation both in terms of military and civilian use and has ratified the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons npt or nonproliferation treaty sri lanka s current geopolitical realities however dictate that it maintain a degree of sensitivity to the security interests of the three nuclear states battling for greater influence in the indian ocean india china and pakistanthere are several concerns for sri lanka to consider in this context firstly sri lanka should be cognisant of the changing relationships between nuclear powers in particular india s decision to forge closer relations with the us presents new realities for south asian countries in regard to nuclear testing by north korea if north korea assesses india as a us ally in the region its rhetoric might evolve to encompass india a threat to indian security even if an actual strike would be a remote possibility would have an impact on sri lankan securitysecondly while north korea has developed intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms capable of targeting us cities there are valid concerns about the accuracy of north korea s missile guidance systems ballistic trajectory and reentry capabilities thirdly there is no historical precedent for nuclear warfare between nuclear nations and the common understanding held by experts is that once first strike capabilities are employed by an actor it is highly unlikely a nuclear conflict can be managed to guard against these risks in a manner that also reflects its legacy of neutrality and nonalignment sri lanka could consider an agreement with both india and china to eliminate the presence of nuclear vessels within sri lanka s exclusive economic zone as of yet however nuclear security has not become a mainstream internal political issue and certainly not to the extent of nurturing a stronger stance by the sri lankan government by way of contrast and example new zealand s nuclear free zone disarmament and arms control act of was the culmination of nearly two decades of public discussion and activism nonsecurity concernsthere are also pragmatic economic reasons for sri lanka to be more proactive on nuclear issues the sri lankan government s plans to become a significant player in the global maritime transshipment sector could suffer significant setbacks if tensions between the regional nuclear weapons states escalate in the indian oceananother factor to consider is the current and looming realities of climate change a number of voices have advocated that nuclear energy should be adopted as a stopgap measure until economies can transition to a fully renewable model in view of its security interests however it would be more sensible for sri lanka to pursue a robust antinuclear policy which includes avoiding nuclear power for civilian usecivilian use of nuclear energy has often been a precursor to a nuclear weapons programme this was the case for india and pakistan with the atoms for peace programme while sri lanka is very unlikely to attempt to gain access to nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future it should adopt a strict nonnuclear policy if it is to play a regional leadership role in nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament smaller states that have successfully advocated for nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation such as austria and new zealand have rejected nuclear power as an energy source or have made attempts to dismantle or halt the construction of nuclear reactors this however need not preclude research on nuclear technology as has been the case in austria where the global headquarters of the international atomic agency iaea is locatedthere are other reasons to reject the introduction of nuclear power as an energy source in sri lanka sri lanka as a developing nation suffers from weak management as far as its energy infrastructure is concerned even economically advanced nations have clearly inadequate safeguards against natural catastrophes like earthquakes and tsunamis as was demonstrated by the destruction of the fukushima nuclear power plant in japan by a tsunami additionally sri lanka s small size does not permit it the luxury of isolating large tracts of land as sacrifice zones in the case of a nuclear catastrophe the way forwardthe larger question of how to manage nuclear regimes remains controversial with no global agreement between the main nuclear weapons states and the nonnuclear weapons states the former continues to push an agenda of nonproliferation while a majority of nonnuclear weapons states especially ones from the global south are pushing for disarmament as indicated by their active role in the formulation of the nuclear ban treatythe north korean nuclear crisis presents an opportunity for sri lanka to regain its strong reputation as a global citizen on issues of peace and security by revisiting the sri lankaled declaration in of the indian ocean as a zone of peace sri lanka should also work within the nonaligned movement as an advocate for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament by creating strategic partnerships with states such as indonesia that are currently active in global nuclear disarmament foradespite its current limited political influence on the global stage sri lanka should not shy away from engaging in the nuclear debate the role of smaller states such as costa rica which played a crucial role in the recent adoption of the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty is an indication that small powers can help shape the global conversation on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament malinda meegoda is a research associate at the lakshman

 geopolitical tug of war between india and china for the indian ocean in case of china s one belt one road initiative is implemented by ruwani weerasinghesince th century indian ocean has been a source of disseminating cultural political economic social transformation across the regions also it remained as a significant trade agent due to its strategic location and abundance of natural resources in comparison to atlantic ocean the indian ocean had always been a perfect trading ground due to one crucial feature predictable monsoon currents therefore indian ocean as an ancient trade hub was commonly known as monsoon market nevertheless with globalization the economic and political concentration is shift from western to eastern countries and as a result indian ocean its significance has rapidly increased by becoming world s busiest waterwaysmoreover india has been the heart of trade in indian ocean famous for its aromatic species but china has been considered as the brain of trade in indian ocean as a leader of initiating famous silk route to export its rich silk to mediterranean and establishing tradetherefore it s evident that china and india continuously contest to gain the ownership and control in indian ocean unveiling geopolitical trauma between china india these two asian giants with hunger to thrive scuffle to gain control of indian ocean as their power house this was apparent in when chinese president xi jinping announced china s most ambitious foreign policy and economic initiative building st century silk road and a maritime silk road msr collectively referred to as one belt one road obor with obor geopolitics of the indian oceans unfolded as india opposed the initiative worried about losing dominance in indian ocean and accused china for lack of transparency in the initiative many scholars policymakers view that obor has emerged as a theater of present geopoliticsfigure comparison of old silk route and obor routes source economist geopolitics between two asian giants china india were ignited brought into a new level when obor initiative was introduced however china s economic awakening as a geoeconomic leader started flexing its economic muscle to achieve its hidden geopolitical motives and intimidate other rising economies like india via introduction of msr this is evident as china is investing usd trillion by providing loans at a low cost to the majority of countries involved to realize msr as a realityalthough china india compete to gain control of resourcerich indian ocean according to united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos no ocean belongs to any one country therefore indian ocean does not belong to india considering of india s trade volume and of trade value is coming via the indian ocean more importantly of india s crude oil requirement is imported via the indian ocean comparatively china receives of its oil from middle east via indian ocean but overall its estimated that of the world off shore oil production comes from the indian ocean hence indian ocean plays a pivotal role for the development of sea trade equally sea routes through the indian ocean are very important to china s maritime trade and energy supply if msr is implemented there is a direct threat not only to india in terms of trade but to other countries like sri lanka as well overall msr can be envisaged as an economic corridor with unprecedented scale and depthfrom ancient times since sri lanka shares a vital geostrategic position in indian ocean and it s evident that india and china contest to gain supremacy in indian ocean by considering sri lanka as the strategic point many view that sri lanka is set to become a destination of choice among investors searching to tap opportunities in indian ocean trade due to its strategic location hence in order to gain trade economic supremacy in indian ocean both countries have played well to gain access to sri lankan ports this is evident by china buying hambanthota port in leaving sri lanka with usd billion debt india has also shown interest in developing sri lanka s trincomalee port many researches view that aim of msr is to transform sri lanka into a trade hub in the indian ocean hence whoever gains majority of geopolitical controlinfluence in sri lanka ports can win supremacy in indian oceanas highlighted previously it is evident that china is much competitive than india and assertive in gaining control in india ocean via msr by providing aids to build maritime infrastructure in countries that are geostrategic but india s poor maritime infrastructure compared to china is the main barrier for it to gain control of maritime trade in indian ocean and to obtain firstmover advantage this is evident in global logistics performance index lpi world bank when comparing india s china s maritime infrastructure quality china is ahead of india as a countermeasure for this indian government has launched sagarmala in order to expand the capacity of ports across indiahence there are certain economic shortcomings egbureaucratic and physical impediments to the flows of goods will hinder india being economically integrated in indian ocean and hence from yielding fullbenefits from msr further india has neither the resources nor the political and economic weight to put in place competitive and alternative trade networks on a global scale therefore india s failure to fullprofit from msr will lead it to become isolated in the south asian region and in global tradecurrently among the brics acronym for an association of five major emerging national economies brazil russia india china south africa india is dependent upon billion worth of chinese imports whereas china imports billion worth of goods from india hence comparatively india s dependency on china for trade is significant compared to china s dependency for trade on india if india refuses to adhere to msr initiative china may retaliate by imposing trade restrictions on india by intimidating other fta like association of southeast asian nations asean to control trade of indiain asean china imports nearly of total trade in asean but india only accounts for of the same it can be evaluated that despite india s act east initiative its reluctance to open up to trade with asean has ceded trade opportunity to china therefore it s evident that india lacks a strong international trade policy to yield the best from its strategic geolocation in indian ocean in which china gained overall china has gained better foothold in asian region than india to benefit from trade negotiations especially with emerging economies like aseanmsr will help to develop india s infrastructure that it presently unable to operate in full capacity due to certain internal shortcomings considering high youth unemployment india cannot merely ignore the economic benefits of msr but ultimately msr is viewed as an attempt by china to tie trade opportunities with india and other south asian countries while steadily improving china s economic and maritime posture in indian oceanindia had always opposed msr initiative viewing that china s hidden agenda on gaining supremacy in indian ocean for better trade opportunities with its rising economic trade demands moreover prolonged strategic distrust between chinaindia is a disturbance on the success of chinaindia relationship for msr although obor appears to be a promising economic development it lacks transparency which makes it difficult to capitalize the initiative fully further msr is viewed as a mechanism to promote chinese hegemony in indian ocean notably via msr china can keep running the world s factory of chinese imports to the rest of the world hence china will not likely to allow the relationship with india to deter as the relationship is valuable to them not only economically but also geopolitically its viewed that over the next decade indian ocean region s countries can become emerging economies by utilizing their natural resources many researchers are optimistic on msr s effect globally as the focus of msr is to support and facilitate booming trade growth between asia and africa msr will create a new regional economic order once its implemented hence msr is not only an economic project but also a very strategic geopolitical projectfurther msr initiative is an indication that china has identified this competence wellahead of its main counterpart india with msr there will be changes to seaborne energy trade for south asian countries as its evident that both countries are hungry for growing energy demand that is mostly satisfied via indian ocean s sea trade hence if india refuses to join msr there can be disruptions to india s seaborne energy trade hampering sustainability of india s emerging economyin order to settle geopolitical tugofwar between india and china the only win method is entering into mutual agreement it has been highlighted that china s latest msr proposal will be hindered by the strategic distrust and political risks between china and india furthermore due to geopolitical spectrum that extends from peaceful collaboration to global conflagration msr is more of politicaleconomic project with territorial consequence to diffuse china s world dominance to other rising countries like indiafinally it s time to reflect on the days beyond and maintain the same cordial relationships the countries maintained in ancient times for silk route also considering current threats to maritime security it is pertinent to note that overcoming such situations could only be possible through a combined effort hence in the current situation respecting each other s political and economic interests to safeguard the future prospects should be the prime concern of india and chinathe writer can be contacted on supunrwhotmailcom

 outlook stable press release fitch ratingscolombo february fitch ratings has affirmed sri lankabased conglomerate richard pieris company plc s rich national longterm rating at alka with a stable outlookfitch has also affirmed the national rating on rich s outstanding senior unsecured debentures at alka the affirmation of rich s ratings reflects our view that the improvement in the group s adjusted net leverage was offset by the underperformance in its tyre business and some segments in the plastics sector over the last months and the risks around their recovery prospects over the medium term limiting any positive rating action rich s leverage improved to x by the financial year ended march fy and x by december from x in fy which compares well with the x level below which we may take positive rating action on rich the leverage improvement was also underpinned by a major increase in global tea prices over the last months which has helped to offset the high cost structure in the plantation business although current price levels may not be sustainable over the longer termrich s rating also reflects the group s diversified cash flows market leadership in several of its segments and the company s wellestablished operating history we also expect the company to increase capex in the next two years in a bid to expand production capacity in the retail rubber and palm oil segments which may also keep leverage from improving materially below in that periodkey rating drivers retail to drive growth we expect store expansion and a shift in consumer preference towards hypermarkets and supermarkets to lead to doubledigit revenue growth for the company s retail segment in the medium term rich s retail revenue growth slowed in hfy amid a weak macroeconomic environment and higher indirect taxes but these pressures eased in q as consumers adjusted to higher costs and we expect the moderate improvement to continue in the next months we believe the sector s ebitda margin will contract slightly to around in the medium term from in fy as the opening of new stores and the introduction of a smallerstore format could weigh on costs sri lanka s supermarket penetration which is only around indicates growth potential for the industry over the longer term increasing per capita income and rising urbanisation will help make the modern grocery retail concept more affordable and accessible to a larger portion of the population risks in plastics and tyres we do not expect a nearterm recovery in the company s plastics business as domestic demand for its key products polyurethane pu mattresses and water tanks may remain sluggish amid weak economic conditions margin pressure in the pu mattress segment stemming from raw material shortages could also take time to resolve the company is investing to expand export revenues in this sector but we believe potential risks over establishing its brand name and penetrating distribution networks in new markets could prevent the company from realising substantial returns in a short period of time we think the domestic retreading business which accounts for the majority of the tyre business s operating profit will undergo a structural decline amid stiff competition from chinese imports steps taken by the management to penetrate export markets may take time to generate returns that are sufficient to offset the pressures in the domestic market capacity expansion in export business we expect rich s export revenue to maintain its growth momentum helped by the capacity expansion in its valueadded rubber export segment new market opportunities and the introduction of more valueadded products are likely to help absorb the extra capacity coming online in the next few years we expect growth in export revenue to also help offset the volatility in some of the other segments such as plastics and tyres due to the slowdown in the domestic market increasing share of palm oil fitch believes the volatility in the plantation segment will decline in the medium term with increased contribution from a more stable palm oil business we expect the segment s ebit from palm oil to increase significantly in the next few years helped by the improving maturity profile of the plantations which will drive yields higher we have assumed that global palm oil prices will remain at usd tonne in fy and usd thereafter rich s tea segment has seen a strong rebound recently helped by rising global prices but we expect the performance to moderate in the next months on the back of more muted prices and rising operating costs however the palm oil segment which benefits from strong domestic demand and regulated pricing should help to iron out the volatility in other crops stronger holding company balance sheet we expect leverage at the holding company x as at fye to improve over the next few years due to higher dividend income from subsidiaries and a decision to cut borrowings at the holding company level subsidiaries will fund their own expansion reducing dependency on the holding company however an increase in subsidiaries leverage could weigh on the rating due to the structural subordination of the holding company s debt currently the structural subordination is minimal due to low subsidiary debt and the holding company s strong ownership of most of the operating subsidiaries which provides for a high degree of cash fungibility within the consolidated group derivation summary rich has diversified cash flows similar to hemas holdings plc aalkastable and sunshine holdings plc alkastable rich is rated two notches below hemas to reflect its large exposure to the cyclical plantation sector which increases business risk as well as rich s higher leverage rich is rated one notch higher than sunshine due to its stronger business risk profile from a lower exposure to the cyclical plantation segment compared with sunshine as well as substantially higher cash flows from its defensive grocery retail business and larger operating scale both companies have similar financial risk due to sunshine s latest acquisition lion brewery ceylon plc alkanegative is rated higher than rich on the basis of lion s market leadership in sri lanka s protected beer market rich is rated one notch above consumer durables retailer singer sri lanka plc alkastable to reflect rich s stronger business risk profile which is reflected in its cash flow diversity and lower leverage key assumptions fitch s key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer revenue growth to average in the low teens from fy fy due to expansion in the retail and rubber sectors and strong contributions from the palm oil sector ebitdar margin to contract and stabilise at around in the next two to three years amid cost pressures competition and higher fixed costs stemming from capacity expansion annual capex to increase to about lkr billion on average to support the planned expansion dividend payout ratio of about of net income to be maintained over fy fy no ma activity or further equity infusions to the financial sector assumed in the next two to three years rating sensitivities developments that may individually or collectively lead to positive rating action a sustained improvement in rich s adjusted net debtebitdar adjusted for finance subsidiary to below x fy x a sustained improvement in the holding company s net debtebitdar to below x fy x developments that may individually or collectively lead to negative rating action a sustained increase in rich s adjusted net debtebitdar adjusted for finance subsidiary to over x rich s adjusted ebitdar coverage of gross interest and rent adjusted for finance subsidiary falling below x on a sustained basis fy x significant investment in noncore business activities which could adversely impact the profitability or cash flow generation of the group liquidity comfortable liquidity position as at enddecember rich had about lkr billion of unrestricted cash and lkr billion in unutilised credit facilities to meet lkr billion of debt excluding finance subsidiary obligations maturing in the next months we do not expect rich to generate positive free cash flow in the next months due to high capex and shareholder returns rich has another lkr billion of shortterm working capitalrelated debt which we expect to be rolled over

cse feature interview cse records strongest ever start to a year in terms of foreign investmentrecord breaking foreign investment in the sri lankan stock market has continued into with rs billion in net foreign purchases during the month of january a new record for the first month of any given year the month recorded rs billion in foreign purchases in the market while foreign investors made sales worth rs billion which has established a record breaking start to the year in terms of net foreign purchases in this interview the head of market development at cse mr niroshan wijesundere discusses foreign investor participation in the market at present and the investment climatethere are signs of the foreign investor interest in the market continuing in can you comment on thisforeign investors indicated a renewed interest in sri lankan stocks in with record breaking purchases worth rs billion and we have seen that momentum continue into as well the level of interest we have seen within the very first month of the year is quite encouraging and indicates that sri lankan stocks remain attractive to foreign portfolio investors especially those with investment interests in frontier markets what is particularly encouraging is that the level of foreign buying we have seen in and in the early parts of this year mark a sharp reversal from during which we saw significant fund outflowspresent developments give us a reason to believe that sri lanka at the moment is viewed as a market with considerable growth potential which is vindicated by the substantial level of foreign investor interest we have experienced in recent timeswhat have been the driving forces behind this interestattractive valuations with the market price earnings ratio at even at present one of the lowest in the region encouraging performance among listed companies an improving macroeconomic outlook and a strong valuedriven investment case have contributed to foreign investors placing their confidence in sri lankan stocks we were most recently mentioned on the wall street journal as the most attractive frontier market in comparison with other countries according to a model presented by the citi bank the model looked at six key metrics such as earnings momentum price momentum valuation macro growth and imbalances and monetary policy the fact the sri lanka topped this list gives some great perspective into the value proposition the market offers at present vietnam and bangladesh who you could say are our direct competitors being other asian frontier markets were covered on the model as well along with countries such as argentina egypt nigeria romania and otherspositive developments such as noticeable improvements in the gross official reserves flexible exchange rate management a recovering balance of payments position strong fdi numbers and fiscal consolidation have contributed to an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook which is certainly important when attempting to attract foreign investment to the marketthere have also been the odd oneoff factors such as pakistan achieving emerging market status mid last year and more funds moving into sri lanka as a result of portfolio rebalancing on the other hand while positive local developments have definitely served us well a supportive global backdrop for asian stocks and frontier markets in where we have seen an influx of funds to asia has helped channel foreign investment to the csehow responsive are sri lankan stocks to developments in more matured global marketsthe sri lankan stock market has over the years been quite unique in the sense that it has had a low correlation with developed and emerging markets and their trends this has been something that many analysts have noted in the past and certainly gives us an interesting selling point considering that funds that generally look at frontier markets look for diversification opportunities the fact that we are very much local in character has worked towards our advantageas we speak global markets are facing a selloff with even most regional indices in hong kong vietnam korea india and malaysia sharply declining within the past few days the impact that this selloff has had on sri lanka at this point has been minimal where we are still in a positive returns position in terms of both the indices when compared to how we started there is a strong reason to believe that the sri lankan stock market is based on local driving forces and the performance of our listed entities rather than global market related developments this has in the past resulted in foreign investors buying into sri lankan stocks at a time when on a global scale the trend points to investors moving out of equities and focusing more on fixed incomewhat impression do these foreign inflows make on a more macro scaleforeign inflows certainly do have a positive impact on the balance of payments as witnessed in which was also acknowledged by the central bank increased international interest in the stock market would lead to a broader focus on the country as a whole and would benefit the sri lankan economy and listed companies in their bid for growth a stock market that attracts foreign investors has the potential to be perceived as a sign of strength and of a marketfriendly environment especially in the context of an emerging country like sri lanka recent developments in the sri lankan stock market in the foreign investment front would therefore be certainly encouraging even to fdi investors that are considering investing in sri lankaas i said macroeconomic factors always come under close consideration when foreign investors look at investing in a particular stock market and the fact that foreign investors are maintaining an interest in sri lankan stocks indicates that they remain optimistic on the way forward for the country healthy levels of foreign investor interest therefore is somewhat an endorsement of the progress been made in a macro sense and of the socioeconomic reforms that are being implementedhow does the cse intend to sustain this level of interestwe are constantly engaging the foreign investor community in key markets to create awareness on the buying opportunity in sri lankan stocks and the attractive value proposition the invest sri lanka capital market promotion took place in australia new zealand and the usa in after a lapse of a year and we did have encouraging results we will look at engaging some key markets through the invest sri lanka brand this year as well and the securities and exchange commission of sl sec has played an important role in these forums by coorganizing the initiativeswe also position the stock market at foreign investment focused forums and business conclaves hosted by neutral organizations both in sri lanka and around the world stock brokers also do engage foreign investors constantly and conduct their own promotional efforts and play a significant role in securing foreign investment into the sri lankan marketwhat we are also now looking at is to create awareness on sri lankan stocks in nontraditional markets similar to what we did in australia in which i must say was a considerable success with recording an alltime record in foreign purchases by australia in cse s history we will therefore look to make our investment case in new markets and also look to capitalize on unique bilateral developments such as the signing of trade agreements and celebration of diplomatic relations between sri lanka and countries with a strong investor presence or potentialin the long run an upgrade to the emerging market classification would expand our scope in generating foreign investments into the market as it would open up the market to a wider base of portfolio investors substantial developments in terms of market size and liquidity need to be achieved in this regard supported by macroeconomic developments and improvements to market infrastructure while this is certainly an objective we are working on factors such as the listing of large stateowned enterprises a healthy positive economic outlook and sustained political stability which are largely external factors need to work in the market s favor for an emerging market status to be achievedfinally how can this foreign interest be used to encourage local investorsforeign investors have certainly been quick to move on the buying opportunity sri lankan stocks have presented since and this makes a strong case for improved involvement among local institutional and individual investors as well the opportunity has always been available for both local and foreign investors and is still on the table the onus is on the local investors to engage in the market and benefit from its value proposition we as an exchange will work on creating the awareness on these opportunities both among existing and new local investor segmentsthe cse in partnership with the sec and other stakeholders are working on a concentrated effort to create awareness among both local retail and institutional investors approximately awareness and education programmes will be conducted through the cse branch network focused on retail investors this year and we will also continue to collaborate with the sec for the kotas welandapola nagarayen nagarayata series with regional investor days in panadura batticaloa bandarawela kurunegala embilipitiya and anuradhapura the series which was held in five towns around the country in drew a keen interest among locals especially new investors who have not been associated with the market before likewise we aim to reach out to nontraditional markets around the country with the objective of expanding our retail baseas for institutional investors and highnetworth investors hni we will continue with the research presentation series conducted with the colombo stock brokers association csba presenting investment research on companies featured on the sp sl index this year as well and we will look to engage the large state institutional funds on an individual basis to present the investment case for stocks attractive valuations and the value proposition i mentioned earlier offers us a good opportunity to reactivate the local hni and institutional segments of our market through creating awarenesswe therefore look forward to the support of capital market stakeholders including stock brokers and unit trust management companies in in this awareness drive and invite all local investors to consider what is presently a good opportunity to

estimated in fell short of forecasts due to weatherrelated supply disruptions we expect growth to recover and stabilise at around in and the shift towards greater exchangerate flexibility since h has

of around in from a high of in fiscal performance has improved following the approval and implementation of tax reforms fitch expects sri lanka s ratio of general government revenue to gdp to improve to in and by from a low of in reflecting the passage of revenue enhancing measures under the imf programme these include an increase in the vat rate to in from and implementation of a new inland

narrowing of the budget deficit to of gdp in and in from an estimated in while these revenue reforms should be positive for a more credible fiscal framework over time ineffective implementation andor weakerthanexpected gdp growth remain downside risks to our fiscal projectionssri lanka s interest payments as a share of revenues remain exceptionally high at an estimated at end far above the medians of for b and for bb rated sovereigns the expected pickup in general government revenues should lead to lower ratios over time but we expect this ratio to remain above the b and bb medians for the

in from an estimated at end under our baseline assumptions mainly on account of sustained primary surpluses and stable gdp growth rateshowever even after the forecast reduction government debt would still remain above the b and bb medians at end further nearly half of sri lanka s government debt is denominated in foreign currency which increases the risk to debt dynamics in the event of a further depreciation of the sri lankan rupeesri lanka s external balance sheet remains a weakness for the rating with high net external debt weak sovereign net foreign assets and a low international liquidity ratio compared with rating peers foreignexchange reserves rose to around usd billion at end representing months of current external payments cxp from usd billion months at end but reserves remain below the rating category median of months the improvement in reserves reflects the allowance of greater exchangerate flexibility as well as a combination of fx purchases from the market inflows from the hambantota port lease and new external borrowingssri lanka s external debt service outlook remains challenging over the sovereign s external debt service payments over this period are around usd billion against current reserve levels of about usd billion the authorities expect to pass a liability management bill in which would allow them to smooth debt payments by potentially extending maturities over this periodhowever the scale of external refinancing over the next few years creates a potential vulnerability for the sovereign particularly against a backdrop of expected monetary tightening in developed markets however sri lanka s track record of accessing international capital markets remains a mitigating factorfitch s outlook for the banking sector is negative based on our assessment of a difficult operating environment this is reflected in an increase in npls following a period of rapid credit growth and some capitalisation pressuresstructural factors such as governance standards gdp per capita and levels of human development are high compared with the b and bb medians and continue to provide support to the rating in the united nation s human development

strategy including a further broadening of the government revenue base continued implementation of economic policies that support underlying macrostability the main factors that could lead to negative

slsfta custom duties on of tariff lines will be eliminated immediately by sri lanka approximately tariff lines this will be gradually increased to over a period of years singapore already grants sri lanka tariff free access on of goods all goods under the agreement have to fulfill general rules of origin of domestic value addition dva and a change of tariff headings cth at digit hs level for some export products specific process rules will apply no asean cumulation is allowed under the fta sri lanka s negative list accounts for of the country s tariff lines and contains sensitive items based on revenue and domestic considerations ie petroleum products alcohol and tobaccounder the agreement international standards and practices have been adopted to reduce nontariff measures impeding trade better access to service sector markets in singapore and sri lanka with liberalization across different modes of trade in services in sectors such as professional and trade related services environmental services construction and tourism movement of natural persons will be linked to commercial presence eg intracorporate transferees only singaporean and sri lankan nationals are recognized under the agreement the fta includes a chapter on investment which provides a binding commitment and framework guaranteeing predictability and transparency for investors government procurement gp is included in the agreement ensuring sri lankan businesses can compete with singapore businesses for government contracts this is the first time sri lanka has included gp in its trade agreements reduced business costs and red tape around customs processing competition law and technical and quarantine standards a clear process to settle disputesreasons to sign the agreementthere are two compelling arguments supporting the agreement at the bilateral level it provides reciprocal benefits for both countries it will enhance bilateral trade improve the economic and investment relationship and provide more secure and open access for goods services and investments in sri lanka and singapore but more importantly it will help sri lanka advance the government s policy of trade liberalisation and signal its commitment to economic reforms by signing a deal with one of the most liberal economies in the world the fta is also expected to encourage greater investment flows between the two countries singapore sees potential in sri lanka as a destination for singaporean investments and a gateway to rest of south asia given the proximity to and trade agreements with countries in the south asian regionat the regional level the agreement serves sri lanka s broader engagement with one of the fastest growing regions in the world asean stronger relations with singapore can help sri lanka s standing in southeast asia and participation in global value chains slsfta is sri lanka s first fta with a south east asian country sri lanka has expressed an interest in pursuing trade deals with malaysia thailand and indonesia in the near future with a view to improving economic linkages with asean and joining the mega trade agreement regional comprehensive economic partnership rcepfuture outlooksri lanka s overdependence on european and american export markets increases the economy s vulnerability to external shocks such as the economic recession in and the loss of gsp concessions in diversification of both export markets and the basket of exports are thus vital to position the sri lankan economy on a more sustainable footing therefore the slsfta could act as a catalyst towards more proactive engagement with fast growing economies in east asia through exports and investmentsthe success of such an agreement however would also depend on sustained political will along with domestic institutional and economic policy reforms to facilitate better export sector growth and investment for instance sri lanka s complex paratariff structures and the existence of other nontariff barriers could severely undermine the success of the slsfta economic liberalisation efforts often create pockets of subindustries that lose out therefore the government should also create adequate safeguards through trade adjustment assistance schemes and ensure that the broader economy does not lose out on potential benefits due to resistance by special interests in fact sri lanka could learn from singapore s previous experiences in complementing a network of strategically placed ftas with domestic economic reforms therefore the slsfta should be considered not just in isolation but as part of a broader strategy to create an economy led by private sector growth and well integrated into regional and global value chainsjanaka wijayasiri is a research fellow and kithmina hewage is a

jan lbo interdisciplinary think tank verit research says that contrary to popular understanding excise notification no issued by the finance minister only prohibits the sale of liquor to women inside a tavernthe research firm highlights that this restriction has no implication on the purchase of liquor almost anywhere else which is almost everywhere that liquor is soldverit explains restricting the sale of liquor to women the public debate is misinformedon january the minister of finance and mass media amended excise notification no of december it is widely believed that by this act the minister revoked a prohibition on the sale of liquor to women the president and the cabinet responded by asking for the amendments to be reversed this reversal is widely believed to have reinstated the previous prohibition on women purchasing liquor verit research finds both these views to be poorlyinformedthe notification that the minister amended lists categories of persons to whom liquor cannot be sold or given this includes for example a member of the police force or officer of the excise department while on duty any person under years of age and a woman within the premises of a tavern the minister s intervention through excise notification no only removed the restriction on women being sold or given liquor within the premises of a tavern that was the only consequence it had on women s ability to purchase liquorthe excise ordinance of does not define the term tavern black s law dictionary defines a tavern as a place of entertainment or a house for the retailing of liquors to be drunk on the spot sri lanka s excise licensing regime has over twenty types of licenses that are issued for the manufacture and sale of liquor this regime includes licenses for retail shops licenses for bars licenses for hotels licenses for rest houses and licenses for the consumption of liquor on the premises in which it is sold there are only two types of licenses for taverns licenses for toddy taverns and for foreign liquor taverns such taverns appear to be a rarity in sri lanka and it is likely that new licenses for taverns may have long ceased in fact the excise department does not list a prescribed application scheme for either of these tavern licenses by contrast it lists an application scheme number for every other form of license excise notification no of december lists the schedule of fees for liquorrelated licenses it lists the fees for forty types of liquor licenses including hotel licenses rest house licenses and retail licenses licenses for taverns are not among this list therefore the licensing regime for taverns lack both an application scheme and a corresponding license feeby notification the minister only set aside a previous restriction on the sale of liquor to women inside a tavern this restriction has no implication on the purchase of liquor almost anywhere else which is almost everywhere that liquor is soldthis begs the question as to why there has been a wideranging perception that the sale of liquor to women is restricted at establishments that are not taverns past discussions in the press suggest that some sections of the excise department have promoted the view that the terminology of taverns in the law is applicable more generally to any retail outlet that sells liquor eg supermarkets this view however appears to be untenable in lawin conclusion the foregoing analysis reveals that contrary to popular understanding the cabinet decision on january to reverse the minister s original amendment has no implication on the freedom of women to purchase liquor from retail shops and supermarkets excise notification no issued by the minister of finance reimposed the same restriction on women that was previously removed this is prima facie inconsistent with article of the constitution however even if the supreme court does not declare it unconstitutional the notification will only reimpose the restriction on women purchasing liquor inside a tavern it cannot impede on the freedom of women to purchase liquor anywhere else

there is a yahapalana government as well as a yahapalana opposition in this country after the august parliamentary election the unp speaker refused to recognize the joint opposition which had over mps as a part of the opposition and gave the opposition leadership to the tna which had mpsthe jvp which had six mps was given the position of chief opposition whip hence we now have a situation in this country where the joint opposition which votes against the budget every year and opposes the government both inside and outside parliament is not considered by the unp speaker to be a part of the opposition while the tna which always votes with the government at the budget and cooperates with them both inside and outside parliament is considered to be the main opposition partythe tna and the jvp were included in the allpowerful national executive council which was formed over and above the cabinet to run the country immediately after the presidential election when an anticorruption committee was formed under the leadership of the prime minister for the purpose of persecuting and jailing members of the previous government the jvp and tna were once again given prominent roles in this set up for example the urgent response unit of this anticorruption committee was placed under the personal supervision of jvp leader anura kumara dissanayake in the first days of the yahapalana government jvp cadres took over the functions of the police and raided various government and private premises searching for evidence of wrongdoing by the previous governmentwhen this operation was formalized in the form of the fcid the leaders of the jvp and tna continued to function in the anticorruption committee which controlled the new police unit while masquerading as opposition political parties the jvp and the tna have supported every antidemocratic action taken by this government in the past three years in august they helped the government pass a new local government elections law in contravention of the constitution and the standing orders of parliament a whole new elections system was introduced as committee stage amendments to a bill that had been introduced in parliament to correct some technical errors in the then local government elections law for the first time in parliamentary history the bill that was passed at the third reading in parliament was not the bill that was debated at the second readingit was the jvp that praised and defended the new local government electoral system before the public in september the jvp once again helped the government to postpone the provincial council elections by providing the two thirds majority required to get a bill passed in parliament to change the provincial council elections system in this instance too committee stage amendments were brought to a bill that had originally been meant to increase female representation in the provincial councils just days ago when the yahapalana president tried to get his term extended from five to six years neither the jvp nor the tna made representations in the supreme court against it thus showing where their loyalties lay it should be borne in mind that the yahapalana president was elected to power on jvp and tna votessince the aim of the jvp has been to destroy the state and the country and to create the confusion that will enable them to seize political power in they tried to overthrow by force of arms a government that had taken office just nine months earlier reportedly resulting in the deaths of youths though the jvp caused the deaths of an estimated people in in an insurgency against the introduction of the present provincial councils system today they show no opposition the proposed new constitution which will divide sri lanka into nine semiindependent federal units it may be the case that they feel that the anarchy resulting from the breakup of the country will be their ticket to powerin their failed bids to seize power in and through armed rebellion the jvp banned elections and murdered voters who went to the polling booth they killed hundreds of minor government officials such as grama sevakas to disrupt the functioning of the government they killed hundreds of transport workers in an effort to disrupt the transport system they killed policemen in a bid to bring law enforcement to a halt they attacked army camps in the south to collect weapons for their campaign of terror when the entire army had been mobilized for the vadamarachchi operation to dislodge the ltte from the jaffna peninsula in they killed members of the armed forces and police in their bid to capture power and even went beyond the ltte by murdering family members of armed forces personnel as wellduring the jvp s second insurrection in its main leaders were not hiding in the jungles like most leaders of guerilla movements but living a comfortable life disguised as a prosperous planters and businessmen with the money and gold looted from banks and money extorted from businesses yet today jvp parliamentarians stand before the people as the most incorrupt innocent politicians ever to be born in this country the tna for its part supported the terrorism of the ltte until the latter was destroyed by my governmentorganisations like the tna and the jvp may excel at talking but are failures in administration in the jvp held four powerful portfolios in the chandrika kumaratunga government one of which was the agriculture land irrigation and livestock ministry run by anura kumara dissanayake with bimal ratnayake as his deputy it was minister dissanayake who presented to the cabinet paper no dated january to initiate the uma oya project my government later implemented this project which had been under discussion by various governments for more than fifty yearsat the end of december just days before my government was voted out of power water began seeping into a tunnel being constructed as part of the uma oya project the incompetent government that assumed power after me failed to take remedial steps in time and the water seepage increased and caused a depletion of ground water in the entire area resulting in damage to buildings and crops when problems arose in the uma oya project the jvp dived under their beds and while concealing from the public their own role in initiating the uma oya project they tried to lay the blame for everything on my government saying that all these problems had been caused by my attempt to divert upcountry water resources to the southif the jvp is unable to stand by and defend or even acknowledge the role they played in the only large scale development project ever initiated by a jvp minister and they dive under their beds at the slightest sign trouble how are they to carry out any kind of development work when tunnels are being constructed the ground water above it naturally seeps into the passageway this has to be controlled by sealing the tunnel as the drilling proceeds the uma oya contractors have now brought down the necessary equipment and the water seepage has been contained in implementing development projects problems do emerge and they have to be solved that is what administrators are supposed to do the jvp does not have what it takes to deliver results this is why over young people lost their lives in the jvp s armed insurgency misadventures one cannot expect failed rebels to become effective administratorsin the jvp won the tissamaharama pradeshiya sabha after they linked up with the chandrika kumaratunga government in they won the tissamaharama ps again when they were supporting my government in but after they stopped working with us in they lost the tissamaharama ps and went down to third place political parties like the jvp and the tna are parties of agitators and can never be successful administrators the jvp s administration of their four ministries in was similar to the tna s administration of the northern provincial council the voting

the provision of free and universal access to primary and secondary education and access to free health care sri lanka has been recording considerable progress in protecting and promoting the rights of the child in the past few years our country has achieved a noteworthy economic development maintaining an average growth rate of over percent while keeping its key social and human development indicators above or on par with its peersthe national poverty headcount rate declined from to percent between and while consumption per capita grew at a steady rate notable progress has been made in lowering the underfive mortality rate of children from in to per live births in in the same period the neonatal mortality rate reduced from to per live birthsover decades we have built a viable child protection system which covers the entire country with over dedicated staff at grass root levels and administrators compared to the south asian region data the ratio of children in institutional care and stunting in children under five is relatively low in sri lanka and the situation has further improved over the last decade however we are mindful that there are still about children under five years suffering from acute malnutrition and we are working with unicef and world health organization to address the issuethe ministry of health with the support from unicef and other stakeholders is implementing a multisectoral nutrition action plan based on evidencebased global interventions in the area of early childhood care and development eccd the government is currently revising its national eccd policy covering children aged years to integrate early childhood education to promote more holistic early care and development for young childrenwith regard to water sanitation and

parts of the country on the status of implementation of child rights these consultations have allowed children to discuss matters that concern them and have helped my ministry to shape up its policythe government follows a consistent policy of bringing together un agencies and civil society organisations in developing all its multisectoral plans for children including on health education nutrition gbv child development and others in we have adopted two major multisectoral national action plans covering above topics which are planned for the period of as in all democracies progress is often not made in straight lines sri lanka too like all other countries in the world is susceptible to the influence of global developments natural disasters and related challenges and faces setbacks as a result therefore despite many successes there are challenges too we are well aware of the challenges of many children whose rights are not protected at the expected levelthe government maintains a zerotolerance policy regarding cases of violence against children and is committed to bring perpetrators to justice as expeditiously as possible while adequate laws have been put in place at the level of implementation children s and women s bureaus have established at police stations across the country look into complaints pertaining to children the national child protection authority ncpa

investigation through the police unit attached to ncpa the child protection officers attached to the divisional secretariats and through the units of children and women s bureaus at police stations the human rights commission of sri lanka has also established a separate unit to investigate direct complaints received through the public relating to children a key milestone for sri lanka in this regard was our joining the global partnership to end violence against children as pathfinder country in as the first country in south asia and one of countries globally to do sohowever it must be acknowledged that a comprehensive system for the collection and updating of data pertaining to incidents of violence against children disaggregated by different areas categories of victims and suspects etc is still in the process of being developed this is an area where the government is concerned about and would require support in terms of capacity building we are also concerned about the matter of corporal punishment and are determined take measures to tackle the issuematters relating to juvenile justice assume high importance in the government s programme to protect child rights in
